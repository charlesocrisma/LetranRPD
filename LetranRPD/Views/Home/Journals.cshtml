					<h3> CLAMOR FOR GREATER EXCELLENCE, ARRIBA LETRAN!* </h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>Rev. Fr. Tamerlane Lana, O.P. <br> October 15, 2019 <br> Political Science</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>

					<p>When Fr. Rolando De la Rosa, O.P. was elected rector of Letran Calamba after his term of office as Rector of the University of Santo Tomas, he said in jest that he felt being recycled for a young institution like Letran in Calamba, Laguna. I do not exactly feel the same thing, but like Fr. Roland, I, too, have mixed feelings over taking the helm of Colegio de San Juan de Letran after my stint as rector of the huge University of Santo Tomas. </p>

					<h3> EPIPHANY AND CELEBRATION IN ASIAN LIFE AND AESTHETICS </h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>Florentino Hornedo, Ph.D <br> October 15, 2019 <br> Political Science</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>

					<p>Upon reaching the top level of Borobudur in Java, Indonesia, on a cloudless day and only the great central stupa stands before you pointing to a sky that is pure light, you come to some analogical understanding of what “enlightenment” might be. You remember the deep darker alleys you have passed through with an infinite number of reliefs—quite distinct and more sensuous relief which tell the story of Buddhist spiritual ascent to enlightenment—and now this great illumination where physical sensation does not have much to do and there is only this mystic blending of light that is both of the eyes and of the mind. This great religious masterpiece in stone is at once an exquisite theological and an integrated technological statement. </p>

					<p>The media have always been a part of society and its growth. One of its elements that had an important role in Spanish-colonial Philippines was the newspaper.

					<h3> BURGEONING DISCOURSE ON MARTYRDOM </h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>Dr. Mecheline Zonia Manalastas | Vincent Altez <br> October 15, 2019 <br> Political Science</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>

					<p>For the Letran community, the beatification of the two holy martyrs of the 1936 Spanish Civil War, Fr. Jesus Villaverde Andres, O.P. and Fr. Antonio Varona Ortega O.P., will now be an additional part of the rich and continuing history of the Colegio. More so, this would be an emerging call for this institution to be more motivated in shaping contemporary mass consciousness to become genuine disciples of truth and humble apostles of Jesus Christ. The life and martyrdom of these venerable servants of God will be an open epistle reminding every member of the community that life is always beautiful especially if it is spent according to the will of God. Martyrdom is indeed a gift to some. Everyone has the chance but only few will experience this opportunity where faith in God is valiantly expressed in exchange of a suffering of death. Hence, the immeasurable courage of these two martyrs is more than enough to be a source of inspiration, hope, love and courage as well. And as pure as their hearts, it would be a strong testimony that we, too, even if we may not become martyrs of our time, should always have the same faith in God. </p>

					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>

					<p>   As the World Wide Web (WWW) develops prominencee through the years, it has become a powerful and useful instructional medium (Robertson, Grant, & Jackson, 2005; Oliver, Herrington & Omari, 1996). As the new language of instruction, it provides easy access to information, flexible storage, display options and publications. Through its search engines, users are given a wide range of opportunities to join forums, read and post messages, prepare and present multimedia reports, and take quizzes via email (Oakes, 1997), among others. Moreover, students with previous experience in distance learning felt more comfortable in the use of computers, thus providing them with a more egalitarian learning environment. Such an environment has encouraged students to think independently without struggling to learn at their own pace. </p>

					<h3> GUIDANCE AND THE FILIPINO YOUTH IN CONFLICT WITH THE LAW </h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>Christopher Hernandez <br> October 15, 2019 <br> Political Science</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p>Juvenile crime and delinquency are serious problems in every society today. Their intensity and gravity depend mostly on the social, economic and cultural conditions in each country. There is evidence, however, of an apparent worldwide increase in juvenile criminality combined with economic recession, especially in marginal sectors of urban centers. From 1995 to 2000, over 10,500 children were arrested and detained every year. In many cases, youth offenders are “street children” who have been exposed to violence in their immediate social environment, either as observers or as victims. Their basic education, when they have it at all, is poor; their primary socialization from the family is too often inadequate; and their socio-economic environment is shaped by poverty and destitution. Rather than relying solely on the criminal justice system, approaches to the prevention of violence and crime should include measures to support equality and justice, to combat poverty and to reduce hopelessness among young people (UNICEF, 1995). </p>

					<h3> REDISCOVERING INTRAMUROS BORDERLINES: A PROPOSAL TO CREATE A DATABASE FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF LETRAN CENTER FOR INTRAMUROS STUDIES (LCIS)</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>Manuel Zamora Jr.  <br> October 15, 2019 <br> Political Science</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> What is new? What is hot? Intellectuals tend to look for the novel idea; the sparks that will make them shout “Eureka”! But an idea cannot be taken in isolation. Along side with it comes the what-it-is-not; and it consequently contributes to the what-it-is. So for a new thing to emerge, there are tons and tons of what-has-been, things that already emerged if not dilapidated or scorned and abandoned. New things are actually offshoots of the old things. But the question is what should be done to the old things? Practically speaking, one could with ease say throw them or worse set them into the flames for they are hazards and liabilities to attain par excellence or ISO standards; and their ashes will mark a fresh start for something new. But how could one throw away something of great historical significance? How could one afford to abandon a locale of marvelous cultural legacy? This perhaps is the dilemma why the Philippine government took effort to preserve the Intramuros ruins. </p>

					<h3> A MORAL PHILOSOPHICAL BASIS FOR BIOETHICS</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em> Fr. Fausto Gomez, O.P.  <br> October 16, 2019 <br> Political Science</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> Once, after speaking on informed/substitute consent, a pediatrician told me: “Father, I decide on behalf of the parents, because I know better.” On another occasion, a physician said to me: “Father, I love my patients so much that I carry out their requests.” How do we evaluate the actions of these two physicians? What will be the bases for our ethical judgment? I hope we shall be able to answer those questions properly after reflecting on the topic “A Moral Philosophical Basis for Bioethics.” From the Philippines and in a global perspective, I plan to develop the theme in four parts. First, I shall speak on bioethics and its possible groundings; second, on the most radical philosophical foundation of bioethics, namely, the human person, his/her dignity and rights; third, on the radical principle of ethics and bioethics, that is, the principle of respect for human beings, and fourth, on the intrinsic ethical principles, namely, virtues.</p>

					<h3> THE RICE CRISIS IN THE PHILIPPINES</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em> Jomar Mendoza <br> October 16, 2019 <br> Political Science</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> The Philippines is experiencing an unusual problem – high price of rice. Unusual because the Philippines is an agricultural country endowed with plenty of natural resources, yet it is now the world’s largest importer of rice. What happened? Why are we experiencing this problem? Will rice depart from Filipino tables? The world still grows plenty of rice but the crisis is caused by several factors. In the Philippines, the government assures that there is enough supply for every Filipino. This, of course, is in the form of imported rice as rice production in the country is not enough to feed the entire population. The Philippines has been importing rice since the Spanish period. This continued through the American regime, and still continues until today. The long queues of people buying rice are not new. The same scenario happened in the 1930s, 1970s and in the middle of 1990s brought about by weather disaster, mismanagement and corruption. At present, the crisis is also brought about by abandonment, conversion and reclassification of lands. Whatever the reasons for such, one thing is certain – the use of land for rice is diminishing.</p>

					<h3> THE EFFECTS  OF LOGOTHERAPY ON THE DEPRESSION LEVEL OF SELECTED FRESHMAN COLLEGE STUDENTS OF COLEGIO DE SAN JUAN DE LETRAN</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em> Rommuel Ong <br> October 16, 2019 <br> Political Science</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p>Logotherapy emphasizes that meaning exists in all circumstances. Finding meaning is complex and is found in the individual’s confrontation with the challenges of the world. How can adolescents find orientation and meaning in the midst of conditions and suffering, particularly in depression? The objective of this study is to determine the effects of a meaning-centered approach to therapy on the depression experienced by adolescent freshmen of Colegio de San Juan de Letran. Because of the seriousness of adolescent depression, adolescents perceive that life is devoid of meaning, they often feel confused and conflicted about what they should be doing and whom they can trust, combined with the conflicting demands of parents and peers, and environmental struggles in the society. To address these concerns, logotherapy was applied to a number of depressed adolescent freshmen presently enrolled in Colegio de San Juan de Letran. This approach would encourage adolescents to face difficult challenges while trying to make sense out of suffering. This study utilized the pretest/posttest control group design to compare measurements made before, and after the application of logotherapy. The logotherapy program is based on Frankl’s (1984) therapeutic techniques and methods. Results reveal both quantitative and qualitative parts of this study, which point towards the fact that finding and pursuit of a worthy meaning lessens depression significantly and symptoms dissipate; thus, results imply an empowering effect towards recovery. </p>

					<h3> BRIDGING EXCELLENCE AND HUMANITARIANISM: THE ROLE OF ACADEME IN FIGHTING POVERTY</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em> Vincent Altez <br> October 16, 2019 <br> Political Science</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> Much had been told in history that the best symphony comes from everyone in the group doing the best they can have for themselves as well as for the group. When a person pursues what is essential for his well-being and tries to make himself as successful as possible, it is a pleasing truth for his community. But it is more rewarding if that individual, along with his success, also makes a difference for the community. This simple analogy stands up as one of the major foundations for achieving accomplishments in many areas of human concerns including the continuous search for solutions to alleviate poverty. Academe is a witness to the increasing rate of poverty in the Philippines especially in the urban areas. Along with the development of Metro Manila and other major regional centers, the manifestations of poverty are also creating its own magnitude. Hordes of domestic migrants from depressed provinces came in to developed locations to find their source of living and attempt to experience some of the luxuries in life. However, these urban areas do not have enough capacity to provide them the best quality of life which in turn creates additional problems like proliferation of informal settlers, unemployment, and, worst, hunger.</p>

					<h3> LOVE MANAGEMENT: A PARADIGM SHIFT FROM A HEART IN HELL TO A HEART IN HEAVEN</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em> Raem Mendoza <br> October 16, 2019 <br> Political Science</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> Ignorance, disease, undernourishment, political and economic subjugation are still the most powerful forces stunting individual growth. But it is interesting to note that an essential feature of the individual’s predicament today is that there is no villain. What is pressing the individual is the very nature of modern society. John W. Gardner says that men in the grimmest moments of modern industrialism are no more miserable than the Egyptian slaves who built the pyramids. It is neither science nor advanced technology that causes the trouble. The root of the difficulty is an attitude of mind that has never really died out in the world, nor perhaps even diminished greatly since the days of the Pharaohs— a willingness to sacrifice human values to other objectives. He further claims that life is harsh, and it has always been harsh. The only sensible view of life is, and has always been, based on a clear-eyed recognition—not necessarily acceptance—of the elements of tragedy, irony and absurdity in life.</p>

					<h3> TUITION FEE INCREMENT AND QUALITY OF EDUCATION OF SELECTED PRIVATE SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN METRO MANILA</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em> Ferdinand Epoc Ph.D <br> October 16, 2019 <br> Political Science</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> Tuition fee increment is considered as the major source of financial earnings of every private educational institution in the Philippines. Apart from the provision of quality education, the survival and achievement of the goals and objectives of private educational institutions also depend on its capacity to generate financial earnings. This study assessed the increment of tuition fees of four private secondary schools in Metro Manila from school years 2005-2007. The study found that tuition fee increments post significant effects to the level of enrollment, compensation and fringe benefits of employees, improvement in development programs, services, and facilities of each private educational institution. The improvement in the said factors in return facilitated the provision of quality education to the students.</p>

					<h3> A PAST TO REMEMBER, A COMMUNITY IN MEMORY</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em> Anna Maria Harper <br> October 16, 2019 <br> Advertising</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p>It is good that Letran spearheaded an awareness program in the Intramuros community, particularly for the students. I was invited to talk about Intramuros that centered on the theme of today’s conference entitled “Rediscovering Intramuros Borderlines.” When we say “borders,” we mean, of course, boundaries. Limitations. Surprisingly, Intramuros didn’t have borders. Yes, there were stone walls that marked the city. And from within grew the city of Manila. But the walls weren’t enough to enclose the minds, the traditions, and the customs of Manila. It spread beyond the city and into the provinces creating what we now consider as our heritage. It is this heritage that we now have slowly forgotten. So now, as your theme today says, we have to rediscover the borders of Intramuros. Rediscover the past that grew out from within the walls. It now will start with memory because as the famous of the Dominican graduates have said: Ang hindi marunong lumingon sa pinanggalingan ay di makakarating sa paroroonan. The past must be remembered. So let me start with what history I have regarding this place. It’s been three months since I assumed the position of Administrator of the Intramuros Administration. But my past with Intramuros goes beyond this job and the role I had played as a heritage advocate. </p>

					<h3>NARRATING INTRAMUROS TELLING THE STORY OF OUR PAST</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em> Jose Victor Torres, Ph.D  <br> October 16, 2019 <br> Natural Sciences</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> Knowing history is important to the student. However, we had never removed the old habit of teaching history by memorization. Who? Where? What? When? This has become the standard of teaching history. The best way to narrate history is to tell it’s story. To do this, we must know all the facts that can be learned. We try to learn everything, the smallest details, if possible. And what I mean by this is including trivia or what we can call, gossip. Then we narrate. A word about trivia. Trivia attracts listeners. In fact, it is the spice of a historical narration. But teachers or writers must be careful in using it. They must only provide a sprinkling of it in their lessons or articles. They are not tsismosos or tsismosas. They must not divert their listeners or readers from the fact that what they are saying or writing is worth listening to or reading. They must blend the general topic with the trivia.</p>

					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> The information found in this paper came from articles of different journals, between the years of 1995 and 2003, that have content regarding motivation and teaching strategies leading to readers’ motivation. Beginning with the dimensions of children’s motivation for reading as related to reading activity and reading achievement, the four literacy personalities follow next. Such personalities aim to describe readers’ characteristics as regards motivation to read. Then, the readers’ struggles are described afterwards. In addition, suggested ways to motivate people.</p>

					<h3>THE EFFICACY OF ACADEMIC ASSISTANCE FOR STUDENTS IN ENGLISH AND MATHEMATICS (AASEM) TO IMPROVE STUDENTS PERFORMANCE IN COLLEGE ALGEBRA</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em> Enrico Calantas  <br> October 16, 2019 <br> Natural Sciences</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> The meaning of the word tutorial in British academic parlance is a small class of one, or only a few students in which the tutor (a professor or other academic staff members) gives individual attention to the students. It is also known as supervision or refers to something more like an American discussion section that is supplemental to a large lecture course, which gives students opportunity to discuss the lectures where in they meet regularly with a guidance of the tutor. The objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of the Academic Assistance for Students in Mathematics and English in improving the academic performance of the students in College Algebra. Students who were identified to have difficulties in mathematics through the diagnostic test in mathematics and the entrance examination given by the guidance center, were subjected to attend the AASEM Program but due to some conflicts other students failed to attend the said program. This study utilized the scores of these students in the Midterm and the Final Examination to compare if the injection of tutorial lesson had an effect on the performance of the students in College Algebra. </p>

					<h3>ETHICS EAST AND WEST: AN ENCOUNTER BETWEEN UTILITARIAN AND BUDDHIST ETHICS</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em> Jerry Imbong  <br> October 16, 2019 <br> Political Science</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p>Utilitarianism and Buddhism are two philosophical systems, which came from two different Traditions (Utilitarianism belonging to the Western Tradition and Buddhism belonging to the Eastern Tradition). Although both systems differ in origin, history, context and culture, both share a lot of commonalities. First, both beliefs seek what is “the good”, second, both are geared towards the search for happiness of humankind (and consequently of all sentient beings) and third, to some extent both focuses on the effects of the actions that the agent performs. Based on these three commonalities mentioned above, we could say that there are indeed parallelisms, which we could find in both systems of thought. </p>

					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p>Ang pagtuturo ay isang sining sapagkat ito ay isang gawaing nangangailangan ng mapamaraang paggamit ng kaalaman at kasanayan sa pagtatamo ng ninanais na bunga. Ito ay isang pagtulong sa pinakadakilang gawain ng pagkakawanggawa. Ang guro ay nagbibigay at ang mga mag-aaral ay tumatanggap ng kaalaman, karunungan at patnubay di sa pilit na paraan. Itinuturo niya sa kanila kung paano umunawa, magpahalaga, magpasiya at humusga sa katotohanan. Ginaganyak niya sa mga tinuturuan ang malayang pagsagot at pag-iisip kung paano ang isang guro sa Filipino ay inaasahang nagtataglay ng kasanayan at kahusayang umakay ng kanyang mga mag-aaral sa isang matagumpay na pagpapasya. </p>

					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> With the current adversities in business, where stakeholders are in search for strategies to contain business havoc, there is one sure-fire way that gathers the resources of an organization and transform them into the much sought after competitive advantage. This advantage can be brought about by Organization Development (OD). It is a system-wide application of behavioral science knowledge to the planned development, improvement, and reinforcement of the strategies, structures and processes that lead to organization effectiveness (Cummings & Worley, 2005). In the words of Warrick (2005), organizational development equips organizations the advantage of being the best-led, best-prepared, best-run with the best skills in adapting and managing change.</p>

					<h3> Abstract </h3>

					<p> The study describes the different ordeals being experienced by ten individuals from the same “walk of life” due to extreme poverty. The criterion for choosing the respondents was based on description of poverty as material deprivation. In order to determine the poorest families living the area, a survey on socio-economic status was administered among residents of Barangay 10-B Kingfisher, Bacoor Bay Sta. Cruz, Cavite City. The result of the survey became the basis for choosing the ten co-researchers. This study employed the qualitative-phenomenological research design, which centered on the combination of existential and transcendental phenomenology, where both the lived experience and meaning of the experience are interchangeably observed, described and analyzed. Through both empirical and reflective methods, it probed into disclosing the lived experience of the ten samples of the househol</p>

					<h3>MARTIN BUBER: INTERRELIGIOUS DIALOGUE AS MAN’S SEARCH FOR MEANING</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em> Jerry Imbong    <br> October 16, 2019 <br> Political Science</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> Clearly, we are now living in a period in history characterized by many historians and sociologists as “postmodern”. One characteristic of this period in history is a greater awareness of the different religious traditions. In some places and periods we have been deeply aware of other religious traditions living and growing alongside our own. However, we have to admit that “this pluralistic consciousness has only fully emerged during the lifetime of people now living.” (Hick 1992: 7) Prior to our age, religions such as Hinduism, and Buddhism, Judaism and Islam, were generally seen as “strange and dark residues of paganism, utterly inferior to Christianity and proper targets of the churches’ missionary zeal.”1 Today, however, we have all become conscious, in varying degrees, that our Christian history is one of a number of variant streams of religious life, each with its own distinctive forms of experience, thought and spirituality. In a much greater degree, we are now more aware of our “neighbors” who belong to other great world faiths. Knowledge and information about these great religions can now be easily accessed. In big colleges and universities, we find ourselves listening to lectures on Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam. Our libraries (and especially our local bookstores), on the other hand are well equipped with books about the sacred writings of great world religions. Travel opportunities have also multiplied and great number of people has spent time in India, Turkey, Egypt, Sri Lanka, and other non-Christian countries. As a result, more people have actually encountered people who actually belong to these major religions. Buddhists, Muslims and Hindus can now be encountered as “real” people in our day-to-day experiences. Such a tremendous awareness of religious pluralism is very pertinent in our time today. The question now is: how should we, as Christians Martin Buber: Interreligious Dialogue.. deal with this emerging consciousness with people of other faiths? Can we still claim that ours is “the only way”, one that possesses the “absolute Truth”? What would be the most appropriate approach to dialogue? How should we reach out to our brothers and sisters who belong to other faiths? </p>

					<h3>THE POLITICS OF TRADE RELATIONS BETWEEN PHILIPPINES AND AUSTRALIA: THE CAIRNS GROUP ISSUE</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em> Jomar Mendoza     <br> October 16, 2019 <br> Political Science</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> The politics of trade, markets, international bargaining and the role of government and extra governmental actors in these processes are classified as international political economy. Each actor, whether it is a country or corporation, has its role to play and its own policies for interacting in the global marketplace. In order to understand the interactions amongst parties it is necessary to understand each party’s policies and the reason behind them. In terms of governments as global actors, these international policies are rooted in domestic policy. The implication of this idea is that foreign policies are subjective and rely more on internal institutions, which are a result of national development and history, rather than the pressures of external forces. National goals and needs shape international actions. It is in this view that this paper will be based – the role of domestic actors and government in the international trade. In June 2002, the international trade market was shocked when the Philippines’ newspapers were flooded with news that the Philippines will leave the Cairns Group if Australia will not end the 20-year ban imposed on Philippine fruits including mangoes, bananas, pineapples, and coconut peat. The Philippines is negotiating to get Australia’s clearance to export the aforementioned fresh fruits despite bilateral negotiations between Manila and Canberra over the past five years and the talks continue until today.</p>

					<h3>SHAME HONOR: THE OXYMORON OF THE FLAG AND HERALDIC CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>  Jo-shancy Bermudez  <br> October 16, 2019 <br> Political Science</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> What could have been an honor for “Concert King” of the Philippines, Martin Nievera to be privileged to sing the Philippine National Anthem before a multitude of viewers around the world during the Pacquiao-Hatton fight in Los Angeles, California, last May 8, 2009 became a shame when the National Historical Institute (NHI) of the Philippines thumbed down said performance. NHI and some conservative sectors of Philippine society did not like it and considered it an unacceptable interpretation of the anthem in violation of the law. “Lupang Hinirang”, the Philippine National Anthem is not open to free interpretation, according to the National Historical Institute Chair, Ambeth Ocampo. Nievera, the personal choice of Manny Pacquiao, received negative reactions from Filipinos when he sang the anthem in a slow tempo in the beginning, went to a march in the middle, and ended with a sustained (birit) high note in the end. </p>

					<h3>POLITICAL PERSPECTIVES ON VOTING BEHAVIOR</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>  Dennis Blanco<br> October 16, 2019 <br> Political Science</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p>In contemporary democratic societies, elections have been generally defined as “the embodiment of the popular will, the expression of the sovereign power of the people.” It is a principal means through which citizens can influence their leaders representing their respective groups. And these represent the democratic nature of the government wherein the people exercise their right of suffrage by choosing and electing their candidates for a given period of time and the retention and removal of which depends on the people themselves. Therefore, democracy can be interpreted as a rule by the people, consistent as to what Article II section 1 of the constitution states “Sovereignty resides in the people and all government authority emanates from them.” </p>

					<h3>COSMOPOLITANISM ACCORDING TO MAX SCHELER</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em> Harlem Guab <br> October 16, 2019 <br> Political Science</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> The jubilant proclamation that “ours is already the postmodern age”1 constantly remains the subject matter of the contemporary discussions in almost every sector. The inexhaustible excitement and indefatigable efforts are coupled with enormous optimism and joyful tone that the ‘new age’ opens an opulent reservoir of constructive, transformative possibilities, not least its deconstructive and nihilistic tendencies. The hopeful project of transformations that the ‘new age’ will likely offer impels especially the concerned and well-informed individuals, circles, and at most everybody to accept it as a burden and task. It is not an accident to mention the term ‘burden’, for surely it requires a creative conscious effort of participants to embrace the final conversion of unconditional service to humanity. The creation and vision of good future characterizes that general attitude and disposition of the present age. Alfredo Co writes, “sadly, it will be a world not for us to see, but gladly, it will be a world we have all helped to create.”2 It seems to be challenge than to induce a feeling of guilt not to cherish and enjoy the works of our own hands before we give way to history. Indeed, it is more than a legacy we bequeath to next generations. An alternative reading of this could an exhortation and gentle suggestion of fast-paced cooperation of many players in the world-arena. That is why, it is not surprising that the most favored concepts and practices of our age are openness, dialogue, inclusiveness, welcoming not rejecting, compassionate not egoistic, holistic, integral etc. that would foster a genuine understanding and could promote communal values in a global scale. </p>

					<h3>THE INDUSTRIAL METAMORPHOSIS OF BANAWE, QUEZON CITY... IN THE EYES OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>  Marie Christine Rio | Edwin Manalastas | Diane Francisco  <br> October 16, 2019 <br> Political Science</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> Places like products also possess trademarks. If products have brands and labels, places are likewise given a certain tag or image by the general public. In the Philippines, every region, province, city, down to the barangay, are also associated with a certain image. These images are attributed to the physical environment, culture, traditions and even the goods and services uniquely offered by the place. When beaches are being talked about, a typical Filipino would think of places such as Palawan, Boracay, Batangas, Bohol, and Puerto Galera. Historical artifacts in the Philippines are connected with the antique houses of Vigan, walls of Intramuros, Corregidor and Mount Samat in Bataan, and Magellan’s cross in Cebu. Although the Philippines is a tropical country, people seeking for a different weather condition initially consider Baguio and Tagaytay as a point of destination. Laguna is associated with hot springs and Buko pie, Dagupan Pangasinan is known for its Bangus, the best Philippine mangoes are registered with Guimaras, and delectable Filipino delicacies are found in Pampanga. Feasts and celebrations are associated with Lucban, Quezon for the Pahiyas, Fertility Dance and Rites in Obando Bulacan, and the MassKara Festival of Bacolod City.</p>

					<h3>ASSESSMENT OF THE IMMUNOMODULATORY EFFECT OF COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE GREEN BARLEY EXTRACT ON JUVENILE NILE TILAPIA (OREOCHROMIS NILOTICUS LINN.) ASSESSED IN VIVO</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em> Anna Danica Tameta <br> October 16, 2019 <br>  Psychology</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> Aquaculture is an in-demand industry that constantly needs to maintain and sustain animals to meet the production demand. Although there are antibiotics available to possibly increase the health status particularly in fish, the use of plant extracts as dietary additive or supplements may be used as a cost effective and probably cheaper way of maintaining fish health. In this study, the possible effect of commercially available green barley as a supplement on the immune system of Nile tilapia was assessed by quantitative melano-macrophage center analysis. Results show that there is a significant decrease in the area occupied by MMC upon addition of 500mg green barley extract on fish feeds compared to the control (p=0.013). The results suggest that green barley extract at 500mg dose may have immunomodulatory capacity and may be used to increase health in Nile tilapia juveniles.</p>

					<h3>COMMUNICATING BRAND DIFFERENTIATION AMONG CITY AND TOWN OBGYNS</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em> Jonalou Labor <br> October 16, 2019 <br>  Communication</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> Branding is no longer a concern of a company or an institution. In the last decade, studies have suggested that even individuals have considered personal branding as a form of advertising and marketing to enhance their value and sense. This paper focuses on finding a qualitative answer to one of the brand asset valuator (BAV) concepts of Young and Rubicam (2000) - brand differentiation. Using transcripts of focus interview and XSight software observation logs from six Filipino OB/GYNs from the city of Manila and the town of Virac, Catanduanes, this paper argues that there are commonalities on the concepts of brand differentiation from the two locales. Moreover, the paper suggests that OB/GYNs communicate their brand differentiations by highlighting knowledge and personal care as stand out themes in increasing their personal brand.</p>

					<p>Ang paglilinang ng akademikong wikang Filipino ang siyang pangunahing tunguhin ng kasalukuyang kurikulum sa Filipino sa antas tersyarya batay sa iniatas ng Komisyon ng Lalong Mataas na Edukasyon. Hindi na bago ang konseptong akademikong wika sa larangan ng edukasyong pangwika, partikular na sa Ingles bilang pangalawa at dayuhang wika. Binigyang -kahulugan ang akademikong wika bilang wikang may mataas na antas at nililinang sa mga mag-aaral upang magamit sa higit na matatayog na konsepto sa iba’t ibang mga larangan at nilalaman. Kung kaya’t para sa mga eksperto ng konseptong ito, ang maging guro ng akademikong wika ay ang pagiging isang guro rin ng nilalaman. Layunin ng pananaliksik na ito na matuklasan ang pananaw ng mga gurong-kalahok hinggil sa kanilang papel/gampanin bilang mga guro ng akademikong wika sa antas tersyarya. </p>

					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p>The study purports to surface the impact of education mismatch and skill mismatch to the employees’ work productivity in the BPO industry. The study utilized structural equation model (SEM) to determine the causal relationships among education mismatch, skill mismatch, job satisfaction and productivity. Two hundred twenty-eight (228) call center agents from four (4) BPO companies in Makati and Quezon City participated in this exploratory study. The data were taken through a multi-aspect survey questionnaires. The model revealed that (1) education mismatch positively correlates with skill mismatch, (2) both mismatches negatively affect job satisfaction and (3) job satisfaction positively affects productivity. Findings of the study implies human resource interventions through trainings and programs that will help narrow down the gap between mismatches and the competencies required for the job. </p>

						<h3>APPLYING DEPENDENCY THEORY TO JAMAICA’S CYCLICAL PARADIGM OF ECONOMIC COLLAPSE</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em> Sarah Stewart <br> October 16, 2019 <br>   Political Science</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> With roughly 2.8 million people, Jamaica is the largest English speaking country in the Caribbean region. Also, a former colony of Great Britain, Jamaica was essentially the West Indian production haven for sugar. After centuries of colonization, independence was granted forcing self-governance and economic reliance on the newly formed Jamaican citizens. However, the country was left dependent on foreign capital, aid and investment. The purpose of this study is to answer the primary research question: How does dependency theory explain and examine Jamaica’s high level of income inequality and poor economic performance in the past three decades from 1976 to 2010.After which, I provide initial data on Jamaica’s economic retardation and highlight the relationships “between the external penetration by the dominant powers and the internal domination of a country’s [Jamaica’s] political economy by local elites, and the impact of that interrelationship on peripheral societies” (Rose, 2002, p. 5). The data shows varying level of cyclical dependence on foreign trade and investment. Research suggests future implications that ensure both domestic and foreign investments fit into the prevailing factor endowments and infrastructure of Jamaica.</p>

						<h3>BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS OF TREATMENT-SEEKING: CASE STUDIES OF FILIPINO ACTIVE DUTY SOLDIERS DIAGNOSED WITH COMBAT-RELATED PTSD</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em> Cariñez Dela Cruz-Fajarito, RPsy, RPm | Rosalito De Guzman, Rpsy, CSCIP, PhD <br> October 16, 2019 <br>    Psychology</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p>Military personnel face mental health challenges as they are continually deployed, and oftentimes engage in actual combats. One mental health diagnosis identified from soldiers, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), has escalated along with their deployment. But albeit many soldiers suffer from mental health problems, only few seek treatment. This is disturbing, because acquiring treatment is necessary for a healthy and effective workforce. To this end, studies investigated barriers and facilitators of mental health treatment- seeking, but those studies had limitations. Using a case study design, this study aims to investigate on the mental health treatment-seeking barriers and facilitators of three Filipino active duty soldiers diagnosed with combat-related PTSD. It employed data triangulation of multiple data sources from all the interviews with the participants, participants’ significant others, attending nurses, and resident psychiatrist. Findings reveal two mental health treatment-seeking barriers of the participants: (a) belief about health care personnel and (b) stigma. Meanwhile, the participants’ mental health treatment-seeking facilitators are as follows: (a) recognition of PTSD symptoms’ severity, (b) desire to regain former self, and (c) social support. Discussion on these findings and implications for practice are provided. </p>

						<h3>BUILDING A SUCCESSFUL TOURISM BRAND FOR THE PHILIPPINES AND THE STRUGGLE WITH DESTINATION IMAGE AND TOURISM SLOGANS</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em> Victoria Villegas <br> October 16, 2019 <br>    Communication</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> Brands, images and slogans have been interchangeably used for marketing destinations of all sizes. However, there is a need to understand the destination branding process and what it entails, how identities and images play a crucial part and the way tourism taglines are able to summarize all of the destination’s value in a string of words. Two destinations were taken as case study areas to determine the success factors for a destination brand and the effect of perceived images to visitor intention through qualitative and quantitative methods.</p>

						<h3>THE INTERNATIONAL POLITICS OF MINDANAO CONFLICT: FROM WAR TO PEACE-MAKING</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>  Renia Corocoto, MPA, MPS <br> October 16, 2019 <br>  Political Science</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> Intra-state conflict resolution nowadays is no longer an exclusive affair among states, but rather played by multiple actors from manifold levels, and influenced by several international agenda. At times, several frames come into play and tension happens. This dialectical relationship is present in peace-making and brings dilemma to the principal actors. However, the collision of interests and worldviews could also bring creativity and innovation, such as the creation of the International Contact Group in Mindanao peace negotiation which brought inclusivity and transparency to the process. The International Contact Group shows the flattening of international peace-making mechanism, away from the traditional state-centered, pyramid-like relationship of international mediation and third party facilitation.</p>

						<h3>AN EVALUATION OF THEORETICAL ROBUSTNESS OF DESTINATION SUSTAINABILITY IN TOURISIM</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>  Sunny Sun | Rob Law  <br> October 16, 2019 <br>  Political Science</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> Maintaining destination sustainability has been gaining attention from academic researchers over the past three decades, and it remains a popular issue in the recent five years. This topic is of great importance because of its potential benefits in improving the life quality of local communities, accelerating economic development, and passing down cultural values to the succeeding generations. Sound ideas often have strong theoretical foundations; nevertheless, limited studies have examined the theoretical robustness of this topic. Hence, this study first retrieved 15 recently published articles (i.e., from 2013 to 2016) from top- tier hospitality and tourism journals and then evaluated the theoretical robustness of these articles. Findings of the present study indicated that in terms of the topic destination sustainability in tourism, the articles retrieved to study are theoretically robust to a great extent. Future studies should involve the less applied theories to enhance the theoretical rigorousness in tourism.</p>

						<h3>URBAN – URBAN MIGRATION: EXPERIENCES OF THE CEBUANO MIGRANTS IN METRO MANILA</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>  Eric Awi <br> October 16, 2019 <br>  Political Science</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> Metro Cebu and Metro Manila are the two largest highly urbanized areas in the Philippines. This paper provides the causality of migration by Cebuano migrants in Metro Manila and their bases to stay longer even though they came from another highly urbanized area. Through the years, migrants have also been dwelling with several dilemmas in Metro Manila. The differences of the two highly urbanized areas in the Philippines were distinguished through migrants’ experiences and observations. This study employed qualitative approach using descriptive case study design. Secondary data were used to suffice the representativeness of the participants’ claims. Furthermore, the data of the study had explained that migration may be viewed as a process to satisfy the needs of Cebuano migrants. It was found that the push factors were few opportunities and low salary rate in the place of origin while the pull factors were the influence made by their overseas family member and encouragement from a relative who had a migration history. Interestingly, there is a recurring pattern of migration since Cebuano migrants became the pull factors of their other relatives. They also revealed some socio -economic disparities between the two highly urbanized areas in the Philippines and an environmental stressor. The unique experiences of the Cebuano migrants were caused by the push and pull factors that led them to move to Metro Manila. They represented dynamism of people who show competitiveness in dealing with daily challenges in order to improve the quality of life. </p>

						<h3>POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PHILIPPINE HYBRID RICE PROGRAM</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>Mary Rose Magbujos-Salagubang, MAT <br> October 16, 2019 <br> Political Science</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p>In an attempt to increase rice production and to attain rice self-sufficiency in the Philippines, hybrid rice technology has been acknowledged and is now becoming a trend in the rice industry. Under the Department of Agriculture's Gintong Ani Program, hybrid varieties have been demonstrated on large-scale farmers' field trials at eleven provinces targeted for hybrid rice cultivation. The current state of the technology has been reached through collaborative efforts by members of the national rice R&D network spearheaded by PhilRice, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), and members of the private rice seed industry. Two hybrids, Magat and Mestizo, have been released in the country, hybrid rice seed production and cultivation technologies have been developed and packaged in the form of manuals, video tapes and other information dissemination materials, a critical mass of researchers, extension workers, and other key players in the rice seed industry and the national government have been educated on the various aspects of the technology during training courses held at IRRI and PhilRice, and the economic viability of hybrid rice cultivation and seed production have been studied and demonstrated. However, there is much to be done for hybrid rice technology to gain a solid foothold in Philippine rice agriculture. Challenges must be addressed to ensure that the increased yield levels attained in technology demonstration trials will be realized on farmers' rice fields leading to increased farm productivity and farmer-incomes. The development and use of hybrid rice technology in the Philippines provides a good example on how an international agricultural research centre and a national agricultural research system could jointly develop and benefit from a technology usable by the farmers for increasing rice yields. </p>

					<h3>JOB SATISFACTION AND WORK PERFORMANCE IN A CULTURALLY DIVERSE HOTEL INDUSTRY TOWARDS SUSTAINABILITY OF QUALITY SERVICE PROVISION</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>Eunice Mareth Areola, PhD HSG <br> October 16, 2019 <br> Natural Sciences</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p>The volatility of the labor market in the hospitality industry, particularly in hotels, continues. This situation puts a strain on the hiring and retention efforts of employers. The hospitality industry is where effectively performing service providers are key to company’s sustainability to provide quality service; therefore, work performance is no longer solely dependent on traditional job satisfac- tion drivers of hygiene and motivation. Currently where strong workforce mobility and attraction to global employment opportunities, it is noteworthy to consider the cultural diversity in the form of social demographic profile of the job market. This appreciation of diversity by both employees and employers can help to create better workspaces that steer job satisfaction to higher levels and at the same time propel work performance to its optimum state. This study has explored the role of cultural diversity as mediating factors in the job satisfaction and work performance of hoteliers. It aims to build and test a theoretical model to identify the mediating factors in the linkage between job satisfaction and work performance. A total of 421 questionnaires were utilized out of the 450 survey sheets that were distributed to six similarly categorized hotels. The Job Satisfaction Scale of Spector (1994) for job satisfaction was adapted while Yousef’s (2000) instrument was used for determining work performance. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze job satisfaction and work performance across specific diversity factors that were considered for this study. Regression Analysis was used to determine the relationship between job satisfaction and work performance as mediated by six selected demographic parameters identified as cultural diversity. The study strongly reveals that age is the primary factor affecting job satisfaction and work performance. </p>

					<h3>MULTI-SECTORAL APPROACHES TOWARDS THE REALIZATION OF UNITED NATIONS’ SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS ON WOMEN ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT IN MANILA CITY</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>Catherine Basinillo | Maria Jessa Tenero <br>June 03, 2020 <br> Gender Studies</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p>The promotion of gender equality and women empowerment, as one of the goals of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, is perceived as essential in achieving all of the other goals. In the Philippines, Manila City, being the country’s capital and center of economic opportunities, is giving paramount importance to gender equality. This research aims to identify the Multisectoral Approaches Towards the Realization of the UN Sustainable Development Goals on Women Economic Empowerment in Manila City. The research utilizes descriptive and qualitative approach and experts involved in strengthening women economic empowerment were interviewed and findings revealed that women of Manila City were empowered and given equal, or to some extent, even greater opportunities than men. Moreover, the LGUs were able to conduct costly programs, projects, and activities because they are supported financially, unlike the NGOs, which catered less expensive but educational approaches. Similarly, the accomplishment of empowering women economically is congruent to the Liberal Feminist framework, which is to deliver knowledge and raise women’s awareness of their rights. Nevertheless, lobbying the support from the concerned agencies is an important move towards the greater mobilization and advancement of programs, projects and activities on women. Hence, the goal of promoting women economic empowerment in Manila City must not be stopped. Albeit the respondents have made significant actions towards enhancing the lives of women, the most critical challenge is not by achieving Sustainable Development Goal No. 5, rather, the consistency and sustainability in promoting women empowerment even after 2030. </p>

					<h3>FINDING MEANING IN LIFE AMONG SELECTED FILIPINOS INSPIRED BY SAINT JOHN PAUL II</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>Jet Buenconsejo <br>June 03, 2020 <br>  Religion and Spirituality</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> What is the meaning of life? Where and how can a person obtain it? Filipinos are renowned for their great love for Pope John Paul II, who was canonized as a Saint last April 27, 2014. Many have been inspired and were given hope because of his divine presence. This existential-phenomenological study aims to understand how selected Filipinos were able to find meaning in life through the inspiration brought by Saint John Paul II. Specifically, the objectives of this research are as follows: to identify the direct and indirect experiences of the participants with the late pontiff, to know how these experiences affected their way of finding meaning in life, and to determine the meaning in life that they have ascribed from these encounters. The researcher interviewed three Filipino Roman Catholics who experienced a spiritual rebirth, a transition from meaninglessness to finding meaning in life through Saint John Paul II. A detailed account of each case is provided. The thematic analysis yielded nine themes common among the participants’ lived experiences: Personal Connection, Fatherly Relationship, Selflessness, Mission and Service, Christ-like Image, Call to Holiness, Suffering, Courage, and Christian Joy. Based on the results of this study, the phenomenon of finding meaning in life through Saint John Paul II can be summarized into four statements, (1) existential meaning is personally constructed; (2) it can be achieved by establishing relationships with the Divine and with others; (3) religion and spirituality play an important role in the meaning-making process; and (4) meaning can be obtained by performing one’s vocation in life (creative source), experiencing a sense of awe, wonder, and transcendence (experiential source), and accepting suffering (attitudinal). The researcher concludes that an inspirational figure like Saint John Paul II can be a great source of meaning in life. Implications and recommendations are discussed.</p>

					<h3>FOOD AVAILABILITY AND ACCESS THROUGH PARTICIPATORY INTERVENTION: DESCRIPTIVE QUANTITATIVE EVIDENCE FROM METRO MANILA</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em> Mariel Marquez-Gagarin <br>June 03, 2020 <br>  Food Security</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> Food availability and access is one of the pillars of food security. By evaluating the performance of the National Food Authority in Metro Manila, the study argues that participatory intervention is the key toward an improved food security program. Quantitative data were gathered from poor communities, particularly from 400 respondents living below the poverty line as determined by Department of Social Welfare and Development. Results showed that there is a low level of implementation of the NFA food security program. In particular, the evaluation results of the effectiveness, efficiency, impact and sustainability of the program are low, which respectively revealed the mean results of 1.95, 1.87, 1.94 and 1.91. This evaluation discloses several components of participatory intervention: treatment of poor communities as equal partners; having a flexible policy or program of action for targeting and services; mixing of evaluation, intervention and participation components; and support linkages. The initial findings about participatory intervention critically delineate the fusion between governmentality and state regulation approaches to promote a more effective food security program.</p>

					<h3>MAKING DECENTRALIZATION WORK FOR THE POOR: SYNERGISCTIC COPRODUCTION OF HOUSING SERVICES FOR INFORMAL SETTLERS IN MANILA AND QUEZON CITY</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em> Julius Porley | Sherman Louis Gabito  <br>June 03, 2020 <br>  Political Science</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> It is the assumption of this study that under certain conditions incomplete decentralization can eventuate even in modest but important improvements in governance performance and outcomes. To appreciate how and why such experiences have taken place, it is essential to look into the dynamics of state-society nexus that underpins them. By devolving public authority and responsibility, the local can potentially become an arena where development-oriented local authoritative and societal actors could forge mutually-reinforcing relations to pursue common goals. The autonomy granted to local governments allows local governing authorities, particularly the entrepreneurial among them, to recognize the limits of their own governance capacities and appreciate the need of harnessing the organizational advantages of their non-state counterparts in order to overcome the gap between the demand- and supply sides of public service. In the same vein, local empowerment increases the incentives for non-state actors to actively engage local governments and enlist their full support to promote their own development and welfare agendas. In this kind of collaborative interaction, elements of both local government and society can find myriad opportunities to capacitate themselves by building on each other’s competencies, complementing each other’s strengths and compensating for each other’s weaknesses to capture and optimize the advantages and eschew the adverse tendencies of decentralization. The focus of current discussions on the technical and institutional requirements of decentralization has left this important aspect of the reform experience underexplored. There exists therefore a need to shed light on how and under what condition the collaborative interaction between development-oriented local government and societal actors can make decentralization, despite its inadequacies, realize its governance and developmental promises. The experiences of Manila and Quezon City with decentralized housing provision for the urban poor is a good starting point for an investigation regarding this matter</p>

					<h3>VIGNETTES OF THE SEXUALLY MARGINALIZED: THE EXPERIENCES OF OPENLY GAY AND LESBIAN STUDENTS IN COLEGIO DE SAN JUAN DE LETRAN, MANILA</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em> Mary Rose Magbujos-Salagubang, MAT | Franz Jude Abelgas  <br>June 03, 2020 <br>  Gender Studies</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> As a safe space for learning and personal development, the school must be open and accommodating to every student regardless of their personal life decisions. However, the institution cannot control the student-student and professor-student dynamics that are happening every day, especially when viewed from the perspective of the marginalized gender, primarily the LGBT students. Cases such as bullying of heterosexual students and unconsciously exposing the student to double standards of faculty members were reported by openly gay and lesbian students, therefore affecting their academic performance. Furthermore, the experiences of the LGBT students may serve as a clue as to how improvement in instruction can be attained in the Colegio de San Juan de Letran, Manila. Through a case study/life history methodology, vignettes of the sexually marginalized in the Colegio will be put into focus and will be a useful tool for analysis of student development, both academically and emotionally.</p>

					<h3>WOMEN EMPOWERMENT IN LOCAL GOVERNANCE: THE GENDER AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM IN BARANGAY BASAK SAN NICOLAS, CEBU CITY</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em> Eric Awi  <br>June 03, 2020 <br>  Gender Studies</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> Good local governance connotes gender equality and women empowerment. This study focused on how local government uplifts the morale of the women constituents. Also, this study identified the gender-related concerns in the local government and the programs and projects in the local government towards women empowerment. The researcher anchors this study on the CIPP model of Daniel Stufflebeam (1983) to view and evaluate the programs developed by the local government and their decision-making process. This study employs a descriptive qualitative design and analysis of secondary data. The selected local government is Barangay Basak San Nicolas in Cebu City. The GAD programs have its essentials in providing the way to configure an integral part of policy research that will be focusing on policy shaping communities and necessitating potential political accommodation. The barangay could work hand in hand with other NGOs. There must be a cross-sectoral strategy between the GAD officers and NGOs. Building more networks could possibly help the GAD programs in the barangay.</p>

					<h3>THE RELATIONSHIP OF PERCEIVED INTEGRITY OF LEADERS TO SELF-EFFICACY AND ORGANIZATIONAL CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR: BASIS FOR A MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em> Erik Jason Roque Estrada | Rosalia Caballero   <br>June 03, 2020 <br>   Organization Culture</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> This study seeks to determine the relationship of the perceived integrity of leaders in a state-owned housing agency as the respondents’ socio-demographic profile (age, gender, educational attainment, length of service) self-efficacy and organizational citizenship behavior. The descriptive-correlational method was applied to 196 permanent rank-andfile employees using a self-made socio-demographic questionnaire, Perceived Leadership Integrity Scale (PLIS), General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), and the Organizational Citizenship Behavior Checklist (OCB-C). The findings revealed that there were more female respondents than males who aged 31-40 years and had served the agency for 5-9 years with college degree. Moreover, the respondents perceived their leaders as moderately ethical with their self-efficacy at the normal level while strongly manifesting organizational citizenship behavior. Correlation results showed that perceived integrity of leaders had a significant positive relationship to the respondents’ length of service. This indicates that the longer the employees stay in the agency, the more they see their supervisors as highly ethical. Furthermore, the perceived integrity of leaders was found to be significantly correlated with self-efficacy and organizational citizenship behavior. Thus, the study recommends a management development program for the leaders in the agency.</p>

					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p>Time series data of the selected commodities and crops based on the Food Staples Sufficiency Program (FSSP) covering 27 years from 1990 to 2016 were used in the study. In terms of the food availability, accessibility and utilization, there is a negative or a declining pattern showing threats on food security condition of the country. As a whole, however, the food security index measured using the principal component analysis, shows an upward trending pattern condition of food security. This result suggests that the Philippines is food secure taken collectively the interaction of the three dimensions. Empirical results validated the major role of experts in agriculture in sustaining the food security condition of the country. </p>

					<h3>LITERACY EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINES: A SURVEY ON WHAT’S HOT AND WHAT’S NOT</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>  Al Ryanne Gatcho | Merry Ruth Gutierrez  <br>June 03, 2020 <br>   Education</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p>The International Literacy Association (ILA) annually conducts survey to identify key issues in literacy education that are “hot” and “not hot.” This survey helps literacy scholars and reading specialists in conducting research studies that are deemed timely in the discipline. Although ILA has been doing this constantly, one limitation of this survey is that the results are limited by geographical constraints and are Western in all aspect. In this milieu, this paper provides an exploration on identifying the issues in literacy that are “hot” and “not hot” in the Philippines. The respondents of this study were made up of teachers, educational administrators, and graduate students of reading education (PhD). Their perspectives were woven together to unravel literacy issues that are receiving positive and negative stances in the Philippines. Finally, this paper aims to become an impetus for local scholars to establish touchstones on suitable and vital topics in literacy education which they can utilize in creating appropriate and apt research for the betterment of Philippine education </p>

					<h3>MATHEMATICS INTEREST AND THE SCHOLASTIC PERFORMANCE OF THE GRADE 7 STUDENTS</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em> Clifford Balolong | Emer Anthony Docejo <br>June 03, 2020 <br>   Education</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p>Factors affecting math interest is a good benchmark for teachers in order to increase the students’ understanding and appreciation in mathematics. This study would like to determine the factors that contributed to the math interest of junior high school students and how these factors have affected their scholastic performance. The data were collected using questionnaires. These were distributed to the 210 Grade 7 students chosen using a stratified random sampling design. The factors were correlated with the grades of the students up to the 3rd Grading period. This investigation found that teacher qualities and the strategies employed strongly affect the students’ interest but factors such as math anxiety, students’ attitude and classroom condition can predict the scholastic performance. Thus, teachers may affect interest but the students’ perception can affect their grades. It is recommended that teachers utilize more strategies to raise the level of interest and give due attention to the students’ attitudes in order to address their need to understand math. create a positive learning environment employing relevant real life problems so students appreciate Mathematics as a tool that can be used in life and that the guidance office may provide counseling sessions to students with high math anxiety. </p>

					<h3>SMS BASED ELECTION SOFTWARE</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em> Clifford Balolong | Emer Anthony Docejo <br>June 03, 2020 <br>   Information Technology</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p>This study aims to find a solution to the perennial problem of inefficient and costly conduct of elections in the Philippines. It proposes the use of the SMS-Based Election software run by a computer program linked to a designated server, computers, and cell phones. It is assumed that the use of this program will significantly reduce the time to conduct and determine the results of elections. In addition, it will reduce the cost of the conduct of elections and this will mean savings for the government. The program was pilot tested in a school election. Using triangulation, the results were generated less than an hour after the voting and were found to be 100% accurate. A focused group discussion with the student voters later confirmed that the results matched the names of the candidates for whom they actually voted. The research concluded therefore that the program is not only efficient, but also 100% accurate. </p>

					<h3>ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE AND WORK ENGAGEMENT OF MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES IN THE 5TH DISTRICT OF CAVITE</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>Carlo Emil Mañabo <br>June 03, 2020 <br>  Organization Culture</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p>The aim of this research was to determine the type of organizational culture existing in the workplace of the municipal employees in the fifth district of Cavite namely Carmona, Silang and General Mariano Alvarez, Cavite and its relationship to their work engagement of the employees. A descriptive-correlational research design was utilized in the study. 313 municipal employees from the above mentioned municipality served as the participants of the study. The study was conducted in three months period from November and December 2016 to January 2017. The data were statistically analyzed with the supervision of a statistician and with the utilization of Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) application. The result revealed that most of the employees from the three municipalities are in the middle age of their career ranging from 26 - 33 years old and are female and married. Moreover, more than half of the total number of participants are college graduate. In terms of the organizational culture present in the municipalities, task-oriented culture was the most dominant. Meanwhile, in terms of the level of work engagement, employees from the three municipalities were assessed as engaged. Lastly, findings of this research revealed that there is a significant relationship between the organizational culture and the level of work engagement of the employees. Therefore, organizational culture affects the level of work engagement of the municipal employees. It appears that, based on the study, having a task culture in the municipality will direct the employees to be more engaged. </p>

						<h3>PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACT AND LEVEL OF MOTIVATION OF COLLEGE EDUCATORS IN GENERAL MARIANO ALVAREZ (GMA) AND CARMONA, CAVITE</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>Maria Andrea Conde-Francia <br>June 03, 2020 <br> Education Management</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p>The study was conducted to determine the relationship between the psychological contract in terms of relational contract, transactional contract, perceived employer’s commitment to the employees, and employee’s commitment to the employer and the levels of motivation of college educators in General Mariano Alvarez (GMA) and Carmona, Cavite. Ninety-nine full-time college educators were randomly chosen as respondents from four colleges/universities. Findings revealed there is strong psychological contract in terms of relational contract and employees’ commitment to the employer. This means a long term relationship creates trust and loyalty to the institution, which in turn commit itself to its employers that eventually affect the level of motivation of the educators. On the other hand, there is a moderate psychological contract in terms of transactional contract and the perceived employers’ commitment to the employees that there is no significant relationship between these two and the level of motivation. Most educators are motivated because of intrinsic factors, such as recognition from their students, sense of accountability and responsibility, and feeling of professional growth. Extrinsic factors, on the other hand, include having camaraderie with their co-educators, associating with their students, and seeing their improvement. </p>

						<h3>PRE-RETIREMENT ACTIVITIES OF SELECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNITS IN PALAWAN: BASIS FOR A PROPOSED PRE-RETIREMENT PROGRAM</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>Edison Gabileo <br>June 03, 2020 <br> Political Science</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p>The main objective of this study was to determine the pre-retirement activities of selected local government units in Palawan as basis for a proposed LGU pre-retirement program with the following specific objectives: identify the existing pre-retirement activities; factors that impede the implementation of pre-retirement activities; plans of pre-retirees prior to retirement; and suggestions of officials that can help meet the needs of pre-retirees in the LGU. Pre-retirement activities in LGUs existed based on the majority “yes” answers of all respondents; the respondents verbally interpreted as “agree” that factors like political, economic, social, and legal impedes the implementation of pre-retirement activities in the LGU; the pre-retirees were “well-planned” their financial, and spiritual activities; and their next priorities were health, social and psychological aspects; and lastly, the HR and elected officials similarly suggested the enactment of law in the national and local levels of the LGUs pre-retirement program. The conclusion and recommendation were the need to enact a law for LGU pre-retirement program in the national and local levels, and the LGU to initiate the formulation of well-defined and for properly implemented pre-retirement program in the LGUs. </p>

					<br>
					<p><em> Mary Grace Guinto  <br>June 03, 2020 <br> Information Technology</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> The study has focused in the development of a product that could help the insurance company to verify if their policyholder has encountered an accident or collision. When the car owner encounters an accident or collision it will notify the insurance company via web by sending the pictures of collision and the details of the vehicle, this serves a supporting tool for the insurance policy holder whenever they encountered an accident or collision. The method used for the development of the project is the agile development method. Agile development method attempts to develop a system incrementally, it emphasizes continuous feedback. The hardware materials that were used in this project are the single board which is the raspberry pi, collision sensors that detects the collision, cameras that captures the images when there is an impact detected. The raspberry pi will send the information such as the location of the accident or collision using the GPS, vehicle’s plate number and the owner’s name via web. A text message will be received by the policyholder when the information is receive in the insurance company’s web site. And the insurance company can manage the status of the policyholder’s claim. </p>

						<h3>TRANSLINGUAL PRACTICES OF KOREAN BEAUTY PRODUCTS ONLINE RESELLERS</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>Harriette Mae Mercullo  <br>June 03, 2020 <br>Communication and Branding</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> With the advent of Internet and digital technology, social networks have become an integral part of everyone’s life. With the rise of popular social media websites such as facebook, virtual online groups have been formed such as the Korean beauty products online resellers. These online resellers as a community of practice is a group of individuals who share the same objective, that is, to offer the best facial and skin care regimen and provide remedies to face and skin related problems by reselling Korean cosmetics and skin care products while providing a source of income to the members. In gathering information relevant to this research, a corpus of online posts and comments of the Korean beauty products online resellers group were collected and analyzed. This paper argues that Korean beauty products online resellers, as a community of practice, observes what Canagarajah (2013) calls as translingual practice which is evident in their online posts, comments and exchanges. Further, this paper also argues that the use of English in online communities such as the online resellers group has become ‘hybridized’ borrowing Schneider (2016) concept of hybridity.</p>

						<h3>PERCEPTIONS ON THE EXTENT OF COCOS NUCIFERA TODDY COLLECTORS’ FOOD SAFETY PRACTICES: A BASIS FOR INTEGRATION OF FOOD SAFETY IN THE SCIENCE CURRICULUM</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>Nova Marie Antiquando   <br>June 03, 2020 <br>Food Safety</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> This study intended to determine the extent of food safety practices as perceived by the Cocos nucifera toddy collectors where one hundred forty (140) coconut toddy collectors from the different areas of Guihulngan City serve as respondents. The study is descriptive and correlational in nature and based from the results of the respondents – toddy collectors’ responses. The set of questionnaires is based on the Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) of the Philippine National Standards. Frequency Distribution, Percentage, Weighted Mean, t-test, and Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient are the statistical tools. The findings reveal that the respondents’ average age is 53 years old, and of low literacy. The least experienced of whom have worked in 1-5 years, the rest 17-24 years. The average household size is about 5.5 and most depend on toddy collection for their livelihood. Two groups of respondents are examined as to their hygienic practices perceptions and their actual practices. As the number of work experience increases, the use of the more modern and hygienic metal screw cap was used as lid for toddy containers, the rest used guava (Psidium guajava) leaves. Both groups do not essentially differ in their perception on safety practices except the one cited on container lids. Neither does their profile, except that the more experienced used the more hygienic metal screw cap, as cited earlier. In summary, according to the respondents’ perceptions, their hygienic practice, in all facets of their toddy collection, is quite high. But if we take into account, their hygienic practices have still a lot to be improved.</p>

						<h3>THE EFFECTS OF COOPERATIVE LEARNING METHODOLOGY ON THE ORAL PROFICIENCY OF THIRD YEAR STUDENTS OF PITOGO HIGH SCHOOL</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>Rolando Pascua   <br>June 03, 2020 <br>Education</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p>The oral proficiency test was given to both the experimental and control group which served as the pre-test and post-test. The pre-test was administered before the researcher handled the two classes for twelve weeks. Statistical treatment was used such as t-test of dependent sample to determine whether there was a significant difference on the oral proficiency of the students before and after the implementation of the experiment. On the other hand, the t-test of independent sample was utilized to determine the significant difference between two groups. The gained mean score was not dramatic because the length of time carried during the intervention was not sufficient. More over the researcher found out that the fourth quarter period was not appropriate time to extract data because there are distractions when classes are about to end. That is, students’ focus on the lesson is affected. Another reason is that students’ apprehension on communication is still observed in every small group of students. The t-test of dependent samples revealed that there is a significant difference between the pre-test and post-test both the experimental and control group on the oral proficiency of the students. Naturally, it is expected to have an increase from pre-test to post-test because the researcher employed an intervention. This means that cooperative learning had an influence/impact on the oral proficiency of the students but this influence is quite minimal. On the other hand, the t-test of independent sample revealed that there is no significant difference between the experimental and control group which means that cooperative learning has no impact on the oral proficiency of the students. This interpretation is more valid because the purpose of this study is to investigate if there is a significant difference between the experimental group and control group. </p>

						<h3>POTENTIAL OF GAMMA-IRRADIATION IN INCREASING THE PECTIN YIELD FROM MANGO (MANGIFERA INDICA) PEELS</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>Rico Antonio Mariano | Eliniel Valdez   <br>June 03, 2020 <br>Food Technology</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> The aim of this novel study is to find out if gamma-irradiation can increase the pectin yield of dried mango (carabao variety) peels once exposed to different doses as compared to non-irradiated mango peels. At the same time the utilization of mango peels as a source of pectin can harness the bioeconomy of this agricultural waste. The samples were prepared from four sets of ripe mango at 1 kilogram per set. Results showed that the dried mango peel of non-irradiated mango is 40 grams and 2 grams of pectin was extracted (5% yield). The next set was irradiated by 1 kGy (kiloGrey) and the 20 grams peel resulted to 2 grams of pectin (10% yield). When 25 grams of peel was exposed to 2 kGy, it gave 2.5 grams of pectin (10% yield). The highest weight of pectin was recorded when 25 grams of peel was exposed to 3.0 kGy that yielded 2.9 grams of pectin (11.6% yield). This study proved that exposing the mango to a certain dose of radiation, the pectin content of its dried peels can be significantly higher as compared to non-irradiated peels thus, can be an alternative to apple and citrus fruits as source of pectin. The result of this study has the potential to reduce and utilize such agricultural waste that can make mango exporting countries self-sufficient with respect to their pectin needs and can translate into significant dollar savings and create more jobs. </p>

					<br>
					<p><em>Renie Lipo | Jeena Sandra Manrique, RND <br>June 03, 2020 <br>Food Technology</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> The overall objective of the study is to develop breadfruit (Altocalpus, altilis) as an additional source of flour in baked products. The matured and unripe breadfruits were washed in clean running water to remove latex and dirt. Then the fruits were peeled manually using a stainless kitchen knife. Peeled fruits are sliced into chips, weighed and blanched for 5 minutes then dried in hot air oven at 100oF for 5-6 hours. The dried chips were grounded using electric grinder. The product was used to bake a pie crust, cookies, and batter cake. Sensory evaluations were conducted as well as cost benefit analysis, with the breadfruit flour yielding favorable results for each. Comparisons with existing products were also done, with the breadfruit flour gaining a slightly higher adjectival rating than existing products. Overall, it is concluded that breadfruit ) is a good source of flour for baked products.</p>

						<h3>ENRICHING THE TECHNOLOGICAL PEDAGOGICAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE (TPACK) OF SCIENCE TEACHERS THROUGH AN ENHANCEMENT TRAINING PROGRAM</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>Erwin Abrencillo, Ph.D <br>June 03, 2020 <br>Education Management</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> The study was conducted to enhance the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) of selected public school science teachers in Quezon province through development of a training program. The mixed method of research design was utilized in the study wherein quantitative data and qualitative data were triangulated. The respondents were thirty (30) science teachers from Division of Lucena City, Division of Tayabas City and Division of Quezon. The weighted mean, t-test for significance and one-way ANOVA were used as statistical treatment of the data. Based on the findings, it was concluded that the respondents have sufficient knowledge in each domain of Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK). However, aiming to elevate higher the TPACK of science teachers, an enhancement training program was developed. Implemented to the respondents, it is valid for use and it can enhance the science teachers’ TPACK level regardless of their age, sex, and teaching experience. It was recommended that science teachers may consider using the TPACK framework in order to develop their knowledge level and to enhance the teaching and learning processes. School administrators may also adapt the TPACK training program as part of their faculty development program.</p>

						<h3>THE ORALITY AND ORTHOPRAXY OF THE ADHERENTS OF PRIMAL RELIGION</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>Bernaldo Eres, Ph.D  <br>June 03, 2020 <br>Religion and Spirituality</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> This study examines the Orality and Orthopraxy of the adherents of Primal Religion (PR) in Negros Occidental. There are two (2) groups and sub-groups of medicine people of indigenous in character being studied/investigated for the Negrosbased believers of PR. The Non-structured (NSPs) and Structured participants (SPs) are working for spiritual healing in two separate worldviews. The former are the spiritual leaders and fraternity who are working closely with the Church’s sponsored health programs. The latter are the group of faith healers who are conducting the traditional spiritual healing without the influence of the official religion. They are composed of the local shaman manughilot/manugluy-a with single and multi-function activities in conducting the spiritual healing. Furthermore, this study brings nuances to the worldview found among the cultural carrier of PR in Negros Occidental long before the western missionaries came into the Negros Island. Moreover, the comparative analysis which is the inter-play between the NSPs and SPs, gives a new breathe of religious ideas drawn out of reflection in an emerging and unique culture of shamanism in Negros Occidental.</p>

							<h3>LEADERSHIP STYLE AND IT’S RELATIONSHIP TO THE SELF-EFFICACY OF SHIPBOARD OFFICERS</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>Analyn Jover <br>June 03, 2020 <br>Organization Culture</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> The central concern of the study is the leadership styles used by the shipboard officers and its relationship to their selfefficacy in governing their bounded human resources. This problem was raised because it is uncertain whether shipboard officers are able to move their people towards the attainment of their established goals. This study used a descriptive and correlational method with 101 Shipboard officers who has just embarked within 2009-2016 as their last contract of employment in working abroad. According to the data collected, there are no significant differences in the level of self-efficacy of the shipboard officers when classified according to age, position, area and span of control except the number of years as a shipboard officer. In conclusion, there is a strong relationship between the leadership styles and self-efficacy of shipboard officers. Their understanding of their own capabilities can affect the leadership style that they adopt. Their concept plus the attitude and behaviour they demonstrate can reflect what type of a leader they are.</p>

					<h3>THE EVOLUTION OF STREET DANCE IN THE ZAMBOANGA HERMOSA FESTIVAL</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>Emie Misil | Maria Christina Wee, Ed. D.  <br>June 03, 2020 <br>Culture and Arts</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> This paper titled, The Evolution of Street Dance in the Zamboanga Hermosa Festival provides the basic knowledge of the origin of the festival and the nature of the dances being performed during the street dancing event and how it evolved from its simple beginning up to the present. A qualitative method was employed through focus group discussions, interviews with key informants, actual observations, and survey with documentary analysis. The respondents were street dance organizers, dance teachers/choreographers who yearly participate in the festival, while schools were randomly selected where the proponent conducted observations. With a fact, that the city serves as the melting pot of diverse cultures, the street dance organizers are still gradually making ways in order to put up “distinct characteristics” and calling the performances Zamboanga’s own. One thing is clear to everyone that the Zamboanga Hermosa Festival is celebrated in honor of Zamboanga City’s patroness, the Nuestra Señora La Virgen del Pilar. The concept of theme for costume and performance is left to the discretion of the participants as long as it depicts the Hispanic influence, culture and tradition of the Zamboangueños. The dance should also portray homage to the Lady of Pilar. It is recommended that the Video-CD produced in this study on the Zamboanga Hermosa Festival should be utilized to provide concrete documentation of preserving the rich heritage of the Zamboangueño culture, in observance of the Zamboanga Hermosa Festival particularly in the street dancing event.</p>

						<h3>THE DROP EVERYTHING AND READ (DEAR) PROGRAM AND THE READING PREFERENCES, VOCABULARY AND COMPREHENSION SKILLS</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>Anna Wilda Tado <br>August 27, 2020 <br>Education</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p>The Drop Everything and Read (DEAR) Program, the Reading Preferences, Vocabulary and Comprehension Skills of the Teacher Education Students were the focus of the study. Specifically, this study aimed to: (1) determine the level of implementation of the DEAR Program; (2) determine the reading preferences of the students; (3) find out the level of vocabulary skills of the students; (4) find out the level of comprehension skills of the students; (5) determine if there is a significant relationship between the following variables under study: the level of implementation and the reading preferences; level of implementation and vocabulary skills; level of implementation and comprehension skills; the reading preferences and comprehension skills; the reading preferences and vocabulary skills; and, the vocabulary skills and comprehension skills of Teacher Education Students. In addition, this study aimed to get information on how these TES think and feel about the implementation of the DEAR Program, the insights gained in terms of vocabulary skills, moral lessons obtained and reflections/reactions cited. The study used the DEAR logs submitted by the TES for the level of implementation, moral lessons obtained and reflections/ reactions cited. For the level of vocabulary and comprehension skills, the researcher conducted a test validated by a Language Expert of the school. For the reading preferences, it used a survey, and for the issues and concern and insights of the program, the researcher used group interviews to students. For relationships there is no significant relationship between the level of implementation and the reading preferences, the level of implementation and vocabulary skills, level of implementation and comprehension skills, reading preferences and vocabulary skills, and between reading preferences and comprehension skills. On the other hand, there is a significant relationship between the vocabulary and comprehension skills of the students. Based on the findings of the study, first, the DEAR Program has not strengthened Teacher Education students’ vocabulary and comprehension skills level for some levels are low and some are moderate. Second, the preferred reading materials by TES were non-fiction but this has no bearing with their vocabulary skills and comprehension skills for it does not show significant relationships. </p>

						<h3>COMMUNICATIVE LANGUAGE TEACHING STRATEGIES ON GRADE VI PUPILS’ READING COMPREHENSION SKILLS</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>Rechelle Salvador | Emma Villacorta <br>August 27, 2020 <br>Education</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> The study was conducted to determine if Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) Strategies affect the reading comprehension skills of the Grade VI pupils. It employed a mixed method which involved both qualitative and quantitative type of researches. The quantitative part included pre-test and post-test as well as the survey questionnaires answered by the pupils. Data gathered for the quantitative part were analyzed using frequency counts, percentages, and weighted means. The study was experimental in nature that utilized two groups, the experimental and the control group. The control group made use of the traditional method which is teacher-centered while the experimental group was taught using the seven CLT strategies. Results showed that CLT strategies are more effective as compared to the traditional method. Significant difference existed between the two different methods in addressing the reading comprehension skills of the pupils at 0.01significance level. Correlation analysis further proved that highly significant relationship exists between the role play strategy and the reading comprehension of the pupils. However, no significant relationship was found between the reading comprehension of the pupils and the other CLT strategies – Information Gaps (p=0.462), Games (p=0.200), Language Exchange (p=0.058), Interview (p=0.089), Pair Work (p=0.077), and Learning by Teaching (p=.307). Among the seven strategies employed in Communicative Language Teaching, role playing was the most preferred by the pupils.</p>

						<h3>DEFINITION SYSTEM AND VERBALISM AS STIMULI TO SOCIOLINGUISTIC ACUMEN</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>Jenifer Raymond Tallungan, Ph.D. <br>August 27, 2020 <br>Linguistics</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> The learners’ breadth of knowledge on the English language is greatly attributed to their strategies of finding meaning to new words and their verbal dynamism to address immediate needs as a member of an academic and cultural community. Employing descriptive design using adopted and expert validated questionnaires and checklists, this study aimed at ascertaining the English language learning scheme and its correlation with sociolinguistic intelligence among 50 randomly selected respondents representing 90.91% of the English major teacher education students of a state university in Cagayan Valley, Philippines in SY 2014-2015 using means, percentages, and correlational procedures at 0.05 level of significance. This educational venture unveiled that the respondents employed paralinguistic definition (4.21, always) over pragmatic (4.11, often), structural (3.72, often), and referential (3.69, often) definition strategies while a majority of them displayed normal verbal activity (39 or 78.00%). Positive significant correlations transpired as the respondents’ English language learning scheme was tested with sociolinguistic intelligence along with metacognitive, cognitive, motivational, and behavioral intelligence. Hence, the respondents’ definition system and verbalism could improve their sociolinguistic intelligence thereby indicating a favorable degree of their maturity, awareness, or capability to grasp more directly what happens around them, thus think and act more appropriately.</p>

						<h3>SCHOOL BASED MANAGEMENT (SBM) AS CORRELATES TO ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN QUEZON CITY</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>Ammar Torrevillas  <br>August 27, 2020 <br>Education</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> The School-Based Management (SBM) is a system of public education which is systematic and consistent decentralization to the school level of authority and responsibility to make decisions on significant matters related to school operations within a centrally determined framework of goals, policies, curriculum, standards and accountabilities. Thus, this study is primarily aimed to evaluate the implementation of the School Based Management (SBM) as correlates to the academic performance of selected public high schools. The researcher used a descriptive research of a correlation type in determining the respondents’ impression on the existence of the School-Based Management and the results of the National Achievement Test from the School Year 2010-2013. The data gathered were treated through the use of Pearson’s r, Standard Deviation, Kruskal Wallis and the Games-Howell Post Hoc Test. Results show that There is significant differences on the dimension of SBM particularly on the aspect of Leadership and Governance and the stakeholders such as the principal and community and the department heads and community. Likewise, there is significant differences between the stakeholders principal and department head, principal and faculty, principal and alumni, principal and community, principal and parent, and community and parent and the SBM dimension on Curriculum and Learning.</p>

					<h3>EFFECTIVENESS OF POSITIVE DISCIPLINE TECHNIQUE IN THE ABSENTEEISM RATE AMONG PUBLIC ELEMENTARY PUPILS</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>Elaine Peña, MAEd | Ken Paul Espinosa, PhD   <br>August 27, 2020 <br>Education</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> This action research aimed to determine the effectiveness of Positive Discipline Technique (PDT) as an intervention among public elementary pupils’ absenteeism rate. The researcher used an action research mixed-method evaluative research design. The pupils with the highest rate of absenteeism during the first semester of S.Y. 2018-2019 and their respective subject teachers from a public elementary school in Caloocan City were voluntarily participated in the study. According to the gathered demographic profile of the pupil participants, it revealed that pupils who have the highest absenteeism rate were male. It showed that majority of the pupil participants have grades of 76-79%. Furthermore, it revealed that families who earned less have the most numbered of pupil participants who were always absent in the class. The researcher tried to categorize the most shared theme reflected by each participant’s response to the interview that purposely asked. After the implementation of PDT, there was a marked of improvement on the area of pupils’ attendance based on the pupils’ attendance form and assessment made by their respective subject teachers. The particular intention of this action research is to enhance the attendance of public elementary pupils by employing PDT. Using this technique will help teachers maintain an atmosphere conducive to learning and support an inclusive learning environment that eventually creates a positive school climate.</p>

					<h3>INSTITUTIONAL CLIMATE AND LEARNERS’ BEHAVIOR TOWARDS A CHILD-FRIENDLY SCHOOL</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>Ken Paul Espinosa, PhD | Quenny Cabildo  <br>April 14, 2021 <br>Education Management</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> This research aimed to promote a positive institutional climate that yields learners’ behavior towards a child-friendly school. This study utilized a descriptive-correlation research design wherein the study focused on determining the relationship between the institutional climate and learners’ behavior as assessed by the public elementary teachers. A total of 150 public elementary teachers from six selected public elementary schools in Caloocan City voluntarily participated in the study. The teachers were randomly selected using a stratified random sampling technique from kindergarten to Grade 6 during the school year 2019-2020. This study was limited to the assessment of the institutional climate based on the goals of a child-friendly school and learners’ behavior. Based on the assessment of public elementary teachers, it showed that the highest degree of achievements on learners’ behavior was “social responsibility” and “spiritual growth,” while the lowest was “self-confidence.” In terms of institutional climate, the study revealed that the highest degree achievements on the institutional climate were “ensure high academic achievement and success” and “raise teachers’ morale and motivation,” while the lowest was “encourage enrolment and competition.” Moreover, the study showed that there is a significant relationship between institutional climate and learners’ behavior. This result implies that a school environment is a factor in learners’ behavior. The specific intention of the proposed enhancement program is geared towards the understanding that the school environment is a factor in the behavior of a learner. This study is to ensure that teachers and learners co-exist in promoting a healthy learning environment. Keywords: behavior, child-friendly school, institutional climate, learners’ behavior, school environment</p>

					<h3>WOMEN AND GENDER IN DEVELOPMENT: AN ANALYSIS OF GENDER AND DEVELOPMENT (GAD) PROGRAMS AND FUND UTILIZATIONS OF QUEZON AND PASIG CITIES</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>Mary Rose Magbujos-Salagubang, MAT | Franz Jude Abelgas  <br>April 14, 2021 <br>Gender Studies</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> Gender-Based Budgeting has been the new aim of nations around the world. This is to ensure that programs and projects of the government are aimed at women and gender rights. In the Philippines, EO 273 and Republic Act 9170 or the Women in Development and Nation Building Act ensures the participation of women and gender in government affairs, including budgeting. Furthermore, the Philippines also requires the local government units to allot 5% of the total budget in gender and development (GAD) projects, further identifying the need to evaluate programs under this category. Thus, this paper aims to compare and contrast the GAD program and fund utilization experiences of City of Pasig and Quezon City (QC), being the two local government units with very prominent GAD programs in Metro Manila, through Key Informant Interviews and Focus Group Discussions. Results of the KIIs and FGDs revealed that even though the foci were different, both cities had complied with the required GAD PPAs as stated in EO 273 and RA 9710. The areas of interests varied (e.g., Pasig is more concerned with livelihood and family relationships while QC is more inclined on governmental changes in gender) but similarities were also present, such as their analysis of gender issues and the inclusion of all genders in GAD. Regardless of the success of their GAD plans, certain points must be taken into consideration to improve the GAD services of both LGUs.

					<h3>USING ONLINE PLATFORMS AS AN EXTENSION OF LEARNING COMMUNICATION – FROM INSTRUCTORS’ PERSPECTIVES</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>Patricia Liana Ramo | Robert Caampued  <br>April 14, 2021 <br>Education</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p>Media and technology applications, particularly online platforms, have been widely used in the classroom. Learners exhibit a more positive attitude towards their learning experience when instruction includes technology. On the other hand, instructors are challenged to innovate curricula to include the use of various electronic and digital materials. Previous studies regarding the application of online platforms have revealed various benefits in terms of convenience and ease in disseminating information from both the perspective of the learners and the instructor. This research employed Social Information Processing Theory by Walther (2008) in the analysis of a semi-structured interview with a participant regarding her perceptions of how an online platform affects the communication process between the instructor and the learners. The data gathered and analyzed reveal that communication in an online platform is diversified and that online platforms provide an extension of the traditional learning environment. This research implies that users of online platforms use such technology for an improvement in both the teaching and learning experience of the instructor and the learners. Keywords: online platform, verbal cues, asynchronous communication </p>

					<h3>ANALYSIS OF THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF SOIL IN BANTAY, ILOCOS SUR</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>Mark Francis Astom <br>April 14, 2021 <br>Natural Sciences</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p>The ability of the soil to support the growth and development of the plants depends on its properties, hence there is the need to sample and analyze soil, especially in agricultural areas. The study was conducted to gauge the physical and chemical properties of the soil found in Bantay, Ilocos Sur. Generally, the soil in the town is classified as the Bantay series, a soil characterized by poor internal drainage because of its shale substratum. Results show that the soil has a dark color – between yellow and yellow- red – and a saturated chroma. The soil sample has a sandy clay loam texture. The soil has a relatively high percentage of sand, an adequate amount of silt, and a low percentage of clay and it is composed mostly of silt and clay, followed by gravel, fine sand, and coarse sand. Moreover, the soil sample is slightly acidic. It is also worth noting that the soil has a small amount of chloride, enough to sustain the life of plants. There is an adequate amount of calcium in the soil, providing an equilibrium among the constituents that could affect the fertility of the soil. The amount of iron in the soil sample is quite high. Iron is needed to satisfy the needs of most plants. There is a very low amount of aluminum in the sample. Such results indicate that the soil is efficient for plants that are acid tolerant. The soil sample has very low ppm ammonia nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen. Such results are expected in fertile soil. Keywords: soil, soil properties, physical and chemical properties </p>

					<h3>COMPLIANCE TO DISCIPLINARY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN SELECTED COLLEGES OF NURSING</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em> Ken Paul Espinosa, PhD<br>April 14, 2021 <br>Education Management</em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p>This research aimed to determine the nursing students’ compliance with the disciplinary policies and procedures in selected colleges of nursing in Quezon City. The researcher used a descriptive comparative research design. A total of 428 nursing students and 72 nursing faculty members from the three selected colleges of nursing in various universities which offered the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) program participated in the study. The collected data revealed that most of the nursing students enrolled in three selected colleges of nursing in terms of gender are female nursing students; in terms of year level in college are fourth-year nursing students, and a majority of the participants’ parents are college graduates. The gathered data revealed that the least complied area among the disciplinary policies and procedures is “general behavior guidelines.” The study also revealed that there is a significant difference in the degree of compliance of nursing students with the disciplinary policies and procedures among the year levels in college. The study showed that the most disobeyed group of participants among the year levels is the “third-year nursing students.” The specific intention of the proposed Action Disciplinary Approach (ADA) is to enhance nursing students’ compliance with the institutional disciplinary policies and procedures.

					<h3>OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES OF READ ALOUD TO CHILDREN: A POSITION PAPER</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em> Al Ryanne Gatcho<br>April 14, 2021 <br>Education </em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> Read aloud as a strategy has been utilized by many classroom teachers with the goal of effectively and successfully teaching reading to children. However, teachers should remember that teaching reading is not a “one size fits all” since students have individual differences and needs. This paper offers perspectives about read aloud as a strategy to cultivate teachers’ knowledge on how it can be utilized in a way that it can develop the reading skills and reading habits of every learner. Both opportunities and challenges of read aloud to children were explicated to provide teachers a leeway whether the strategy is appropriate on their pedagogical milieus. Finally, the concluding part of the paper offers the pedagogical implications of read aloud to give teachers a better grasp of the considerations they need to undertake before adopting the strategy in their classrooms.

					<h3>UTILIZATION OF E-RECRUITMENT TOOLS AS PERCEIVED BY RECRUITERS AND JOB APPLICANTS</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em> Ronaldo Manalo | Jun Grimaldo | Chin Uy<br>April 14, 2021 <br> Industrial Psychology </em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p>Recruitment of employees, as well as the application for jobs, has been a tedious process involving time and resources, however, the use of technology simplifies the process. Online or e-recruitment tools have been used both by the recruitment officers and the job applicants. Using partial least squares structural equation modeling, the study compared the perceptions of the two groups of respondents on the perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and their attitude towards the intention to use e-recruitment tools. The study established that the two groups of respondents both found the tools easy to use affecting their attitude and the intention to use or reuse the tools. The job applicants found the tools useful for their purpose affecting their attitude and intention to use, while the recruitment officers found the existing tools limiting.

					<h3>METACOGNITIVE KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS AND ATTITUDE OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY STUDENTS ACROSS PROGRAMS</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>Sheryl Biscocho<br>November 22, 2021 <br> Education </em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> Metacognition can be applied in several disciplines in various ways. There are more subtle ways to include metacognition into the fabric of any course and make it part of both the teacher and students' everyday language. In today's educational environment, metacognition is a powerful construct, and its systematic teaching may promote a sense of independence and autonomy among college students. This study explores and analyzes the metacognition of first-year students enrolled in Science Technology and Society (STS) course during the first semester of school year 2018-2019 at Colegio de San Juan de Letran Manila. The result of the study will be used as basis for the development of syllabus and other instructional and learning materials in STS. Specifically, it sought to: 1. find out the metacognition (knowledge, skills, and attitudes) of freshmen students enrolled in the course (STS) at Letran Manila; 2. identify whether metacognition display significant differences in terms of various variables; and 3. draw out implications in the teaching and learning process in the course (STS). Most of the respondents were communication students (26.5%) followed by psychology students (24.5%), business management students (16%), accountancy students (14.5%), (13.5%) broadcasting students (13.5%), and education and engineering students (2.5%). The participants were 139 (69.5%) female and 61 (30.5%) were male. More than half of the respondents were female (69.5%). The male respondents with a mean of 4.36 reported a slightly higher metacognition than female. The study also showed significant difference among the scores of (STS) student’s metacognition according to course or programs. Metacognition was rated the highest among communication students (4.46) and lowest among management students (4.16). The overall mean metacognition (4.35) and the standard deviation (0.439) correspond that first-year students have metacognition. Furthermore, first-year students agree that they have metacognitive knowledge of (4.20), metacognitive skills of (4.07) and metacognitive attitudes of (4.03) in the course STS regardless of their programs. Professors are confronted with classes full of students that have varying levels of metacognitive skills.</p>

					<h3>ENGLISH LANGUAGE EXPOSURE: ITS EFFECTIVENESS IN HELPING STUDENTS UNDERSTAND THEIR ENGLISH LESSONS</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>Elizabeth Soriano | Abbey Jeremy Garcia <br>November 22, 2021 <br> Education </em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p>This qualitative study determined how English language exposures through media, technology, and at home help the students in understanding their English lessons. Fifteen students were selected purposively from three sections of Grade 10. A prior interview was conducted before the selection, and students who were able to articulate their ideas clearly were chosen as respondents. They were asked a set of questions in the Focus Group Discussion where their answers were analyzed using the deductive research approach. The results of the study showed that exposures to the English language through media, technology, and at home enable the students to develop and hone their grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation skills which they used in their English class and eventually helped them in understanding their English lessons. Hence, this study has proven that English language exposures are effective in helping students better understand their English lessons. </p>

					<h3>STUDENT – DESIGNED PERFORMANCE TASKS: MAKING LEARNING PERSONAL</h3>
					<br>
					<p><em>Cathlea Tongco | Kristina Pamela Aguinaldo | Calvin Joshper Calvadores<br>November 22, 2021 <br> Education </em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
					<p> Performance-based learning and assessment embody a set of techniques for the attainment and application of information, abilities, and work practices through the performance of tasks that are meaningful and engaging to students. However, with students’ differing capabilities and talents, as well as their economic, social, and cultural backgrounds, these performance tasks may only be good and effective for specific students. Hence, learners’ knowledge, discernments, and voices are vital and helpful in evaluating and reflecting on their learning journey. This qualitative study described and understood the lived experiences and relayed the stories of the learners as regards designing their performance tasks. A phenomenological method was used to explore how students design their performance tasks, the challenges they encountered, and the realizations they have made during the process. Through a series of focus group discussions with the students, the central question, “How do students design their performance tasks?” was addressed in this study. The responses of the participants gave focus and direction to this study which provided a thoughtful perception of this phenomenological study. After a thorough analysis and coding, categories were identified and themes emerged from the focus group discussions of the students concerning the factors that they consider in designing performance tasks (authenticity of tasks, students’ self-efficacy, and assessment criteria and time allocation); the experiences in designing performance tasks (difficulty in conceptualization, conflicting ideas, and self-discovery); and students’ realizations in designing the task (opportunity, challenge, and reward). The students have also made suggestions as to how student-designed performance tasks can maximize student learning and engagement. The lived experiences of the students in designing their performance tasks allowed them to become more responsible, to discover themselves better, and to become learners who successfully faced the challenges in their academics. In the light of these findings, the researchers developed the Student-Designed Performance Task Template that will serve as a guide for both students and teachers during the process.</p>

						<h3>PLEDGE OF COMMITMENT: THE PHENOMENOLOGY OF SCHOOL LOYALTY AMONG FILIPINO SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS</h3>
					<br>
							<p><em>John Christopher Mesana<br>November 22, 2021 <br> Education Management </em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
						<p> Recently, schools experience losing students that might have been brought about by lack of understanding on the essence of school loyalty among students. Capitalizing on descriptive phenomenology, this study aims to grasp the essence of school loyalty as it is lived and experienced by a select group of Filipino senior high school students. Respondents were subjected to a two-part data gathering procedure namely, Robotfoto and semi-structured interview. With the use of cool and warm analysis, three views on school loyalty surfaced from the field texts collected, namely, leading views, laurelling views and lingering views. Validation of findings through critical friend technique was observed to establish the trustworthiness of the data. Intentionally, the study could pave way to advancing current literatures by shedding light to areas of school loyalty that is understudied qualitatively and locally.</p>

								<h3>GRIT DOES NOT MODERATE THE RELATIONS BETWEEN WORK FAMILY CONFLICT AND WORK ENGAGEMENT AMONG WORK-FROM-HOME EMPLOYEES DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC</h3>
						<br>
										<p><em>Alethea Patricia Del Castillo-Arenillo <br>December 16, 2021 <br>  </em></p>
						<br>
						<h3> Abstract </h3>
						<hr>
							<p> This study aimed to examine an apparent concern in telecommuting which is work-family conflict and how could it affect employees’ work engagement. In addition, this study also investigated the buffering role of grit in the impact of work-family conflict on work engagement among work from home employees during the pandemic. There was a total of 159 respondents who are working from home for the last 6 months due to the quarantine restrictions in the country. Respondents are mostly female (77.36%), single in status (77.36%), and hold a regular/tenured employment status (72.33%). The average age of the respondents is 28.68 years old (SD = 6). In terms of hours spent working from home, there is not much difference between those who work for mostly 8 hours and more than 8 hours a day. The t-test results indicated that those who spend more than 8 hours telecommuting reported higher work-to-family interference than those who spend less than 8 hours working from home (t(157) = -3.231, p-value = 0.001) while the data for family-to-work interference are comparable between the two groups (t(157) = 0.501, p-value = 0.617). Moreover, results showed that there are no significant correlations between work-to-family and family-to-work interferences to work engagement with a p-value of 0.511 and 0.684 respectively. Similarly, grit did not appear to be a significant moderator when a multiple linear regression model with interaction terms that used work engagement as a dependent variable was fitted to the data.</p>

							<h3> Abstract </h3>
							<hr>
								<p> This study aimed to examine the curriculum exit of the three batches of the SHS graduates in the Philippines, which was criticized by the different sectors in the country for implementing the K-to-12 curriculum in basic education despite the encouragement of the Department of Education that emphasized the great benefits to the learners’ future careers. With one thousand respondents, a cross-sectional retrospective survey method was employed in this study. They have also given their comments about their experiences in their senior high school education, which was thematized in this study. Considering the dearth of literature on the status of the SHS graduates in the country, this study has successfully accounted for the dynamics of the productivity of the SHS graduates in the country where the K-to-12 system is relatively new to the whole basic education system compared to other countries.</p>

								<h3> Abstract </h3>
								<hr>
									<p>The context of utilizing different classroom activities has a positive and negative impact on the students notably on their experience. The different classroom activities provide students with opportunities to expand their understanding by employing concepts and conveying new learning information. This research aims to understand the impact of different class activities on knowledge, attitude, and practices related to contextualized communication (FIL101) among general education students. The researchers used qualitative interview data to uncover how participants’ involvement is associated with their classroom experiences. Similarly, it was linked in the exploration of participants’ contextualized communication that conceives outcome-based education in the curriculum as well as in the lesson and the syllabus. The researcher found out that These learning activities are used for an interactive mode of introducing the subject. However, the study shows that this approach must be continued for the students to be able to learn how to collaborate, communicate, become responsible, and make the classroom set-up more interactive between the teacher and the students. </p>

									<h3> Abstract </h3>
									<hr>
										<p> At the core of tourism literature, the issue of recruiting and retaining qualified workforce remains a subject for empirical investigation. This study aims to contribute to the growing interest in the nexus between graduate competencies and career adaptability. A case study of Travel Management Program graduates (n=78) in the capital of the Philippines was carried out via a multi-aspect questionnaire. It has been highlighted that career adaptable individuals are more likely to readapt their personal preferences and goal orientation in their career life. Understanding the factor dimensions of career adaptability as well as the usefulness of skills and competencies among travel management graduates in their work will help academicians and human resource practitioners manage students’ and employees’ career through intervention programs for career development.

									<h3> Abstract </h3>
									<hr>
										<p>People are becoming aware of the time and effort saved and of the up-to-date information gathered when using technology. In this context, a website on students' experiences was created to allow stakeholders to compare the quality of services delivered by some tertiary educational institutions. The paper's main objective is to evaluate whether the characteristics are significantly related to the quality of the website using the ISO 9126 model. The first and second-order confirmatory analyses proved that the instrument used has good validity and reliability. Each of the four characteristics significantly contributed to measuring the website quality, with portability as the most important, followed by functionality. This is due to the diversity of electronic devices used by stakeholders. To complete the six characteristics, members of the development team gave high ratings for their reliability and maintainability. Recommendations were made on how to enhance the developed website and to assess the enhanced website further. Keywords: efficiency, functionality, portability, usefulness </p>

														<h3>A QUALITATIVE NARRATIVE SYNTHESIS ON THE BEST COMMUNITY ORGANIZING PRACTICES IN DISASTER RISK REDUCTION AND MANAGEMENT IN HEALTH (DRRM-H) IN THE PHILIPPINES</h3>
										<br>
																	<p><em>Faisal Jackarain | Raphaelli Carla Almerido | Ann Christhel Ballesteros<br>December 15, 2023 <br>  </em></p>
										<br>
										<h3> Abstract </h3>
										<hr>
											<p> Since governments are unable to handle risk reduction on their own, the trend surrounding DRRM-H shifted from relief and reaction to using a community-based approach (Azad, 2019; Iuchi et al, 2019) — and this includes community organizing (CO). With the advent of DRRM-H initiatives in the Philippines, the need exists to investigate and identify what the best CO practices are, in the context of DRRM-H. The research qualitatively analyzed data in this scoping review, and consistent with PRISMA guidelines. The study used open and axial analysis as its primary qualitative analysis method. With search terms among the search engines, 740 articles were found, but only 12 articles were included. Most of the best CO practices in DRRM-H revolve around “all-inclusivity”. Best CO practices tend to widen its clientele level and population reach and/or require multi-sectoral, multi-population-level stakeholder consultation and analysis as a way of increasing the policy guarantee and program reach. </p>

															<h3>EXPLICATING FILIPINO PRE-SERVICE TEACHERS’ ASSESSMENT PREFERENCES: A CONJOINT ANALYSIS</h3>
										<br>
																		<p><em>Joel Adamos<br>December 15, 2023 <br>  </em></p>
										<br>
										<h3> Abstract </h3>
										<hr>
											<p>The Philippine teacher education curricula subscribe to the outcome-based approach underscoring more authentic assessments; however, it remains unclear whether Filipino students’ assessment preferences are also inclined toward new alternative types. While assessment preferences have been explored in other parts of the world that reveal students’ predisposition toward more conventional types, research in the Philippines on this area is sparse. Hence, this study purported to ascertain the assessment preferences of Filipino students, particularly pre-service teachers, using conjoint analysis. A total of 302 pre-service teachers from a comprehensive Philippine university participated. Results showed Alternative Assessments as the most important attribute (28.743%) and Cognitive Processes (13.243%) as the least. Part-worth of the attributes revealed that pre-service teachers prefer self-assessments (0.651); selected-response tests (0.742); and electronic or online assessments (0.393). They prefer assessments accomplished individually (0.047) and those which target higher-order thinking (0.474). Implications to assessment policies and practices are discussed. </p>

																<h3>EXAMINING THE ROLES, FEARS, AND EXPECTATIONS OF FILIPINO STUDENTS OF POST-PANDEMIC EDUCATION VIA DOODLES</h3>
										<br>
																				<p><em> John Christopher Mesana | Ma. Viel Cerize Antazo | Isaiah Samson<br>December 15, 2023 <br>  </em></p>
										<br>
										<h3> Abstract </h3>
										<hr>
											<p> The education sector was not spared from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Disruption of classes brought by strict lockdowns and social-distancing measures was detrimental to the student's academic, economic, and social life. Interestingly, the current health crisis has led many countries to create innovative countermeasures to secure students' learning continuity. Such ingenious actions and preparations for the post-pandemic education setup were currently done. While many scholars have provided insights on post-pandemic education, studies on students' perspectives remain opaque in the literature. This paper argues that considering students' perspectives in creating educational policies is critical because they directly experience the policies in place. Anchored on Premack and Woodruff's (1978) Theory of Mind, this qualitative study purports to surface the roles, fears, and expectations of post-pandemic education among a select group of Filipino students via semiotic analysis design. Seventy-three (n=73) purposively selected Filipino students participated in the data-gathering procedure using doodles. Through Steger's (2007) three-step metaphor analysis, an exciting pyramid model that vividly depicts the role (triad of proclivity), fears (triad of obscurity) and expectations (triad of amenability) of the Filipino students about the post-pandemic education was developed. The findings of this study may inform policies and practices in preparation for the post-pandemic education setting.</p>

																		<h3>THE USE OF CHOICE BOARDS IN DIFFERENTIATING INSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPING STUDENT AGENCY</h3>
											<br>
																							<p><em> Cathlea Tongco | Catherine Joyce Escurel | May Anne Mudlong<br>May 19, 2025 <br>  </em></p>
											<br>
											<h3> Abstract </h3>
											<hr>
												<p>Students possess distinct characteristics brought by genetics and life and educational experiences, so teachers assume and recognize the students' individual differences having various interests and levels of preparation. Hence, students with diverse learning styles necessitate differentiated education. Self-determination theory states that autonomy, relatedness, and competence are needed for growth and integration. Several studies also show that when students have a choice in learning, there is positive student engagement and self-motivation. This qualitative study intended to describe and relay the perceptions of students on the use of choice boards as a tool for differentiating instruction and developing student agency. Its design is phenomenological, following ethical standards in data collection and focusing on the experiences of Grade 9 students from Colegio de San Juan de Letran – Manila. The study revealed the perceptions of students as they use choice boards in science manifesting three themes: a plethora of options and opportunities, choosing to win, one choice at a time, and students as managers of their own learning. The study also revealed that students can be overwhelmed due to the many options on the choice boards. Nevertheless, they become more responsible in planning for their learning. These imply the need for teachers and students to carefully plan the activities and tasks that will be included in the choice boards so they will be more effective in developing student agency and differentiating instruction. </p>

											<h3> Abstract </h3>
											<hr>
												<p>Ang salitang “paghihirap” ay mayroong iba’t ibang pakahulugan mula sa mga tao. Maaaripinansyal, intelektuwal, emosyonal o sosyolohikal ang pinatutungkulan nito. Maaari rin naman na ang mahirap para sa isa ay madali para sa iba o ang madali at magihawa pa sa ilan ay mahirap para sa nakararami. Upang mabigyang paglalarawan ang konsepto ng paghihirap sa lente ng estudyanteng Pilipino, ang pag-aaral na ito ay isinagawa. Dahil may potensiyal ang wikang Filipino na maitanghal ang pagtingin at pagdama sa pamamagitan ng pagpapaliwanag na hindi kayang maisagawa gamit ang ibang wika, ang pag-aaral na ito ay isinagawa gamit ang wikang Filipino. Ang pag-aaral na ito ay ginamitan ng kuwalitatibong pamamaraan: at dahil nais tukuyin ng pag-aaral na ito ang mga perspektibo ng mga mag-aaral, ang mga tagatugon ay mga napiling mag-aaral ng Colegio de San Juan de Letran na nasa unang taon. </p>

																				<h3>A QUANTITATIVE STUDY ON JARGONS IN RESEARCH OUTPUTS AS BASIS FOR SYLLABUS DEVELOPMENT</h3>
											<br>

											<h3> Abstract </h3>
											<hr>
												<p>Research in Daily Life 02 (Quantitative Research) is an applied subject in Senior High School. It encourages students to showcase their application skills through investigative projects. Thus, research works tends to be heavy with “jargons.” To strengthen the current curriculum of PR2 in Letran Manila, the research outputs of students in Quantitative Research undergo linguistic analysis. Data reveals that “Statement of the Problem” and “Conclusions” are the sections that are very specific to the students’ discipline. In contrast, “Sampling Method” is the section that makes use of specialized words the least. It is further found out that jargon usage in the papers’ “Introduction,” “Methodology,” “Results,” and “Discussion” has a significant difference. This solidifies that each section of the paper shall not be taught with sameness in pedagogy. Certain parts of the course syllabus for CTRDL02/PR2 must be contextualized, promoting an extensive collaboration with Specialized Subject teachers from each learning strand. </p>

														<p> This descriptive study determined the emotional intelligence, attachment style, as well as the lived experiences of fathers of children with special needs. Specifically, the objectives of this research are the following: to ascertain the profile of fathers in relation to emotional intelligence and attachment style and to determine the experiences of father respondents in relation with their children with special needs. The researchers interviewed, administered psychological tests and questionnaires namely, the BarOn Emotional Quotient Inventory: Short and the Vulnerable Attachment Style Questionnaire to five Filipino fathers who have children with special needs. The participants have at least one child with special needs like cerebral palsy, autism and ADHD. Based on the result of the study, most of the participants have low emotional intelligence and their attachment style is more likely to be vulnerable. The thematic analysis yielded three themes common among the participants’ lived experiences with their children namely financial difficulties, emotional difficulties and strategic coping. Implications, limitations and recommendations of this study are discussed.</p>

														<h3> Abstract </h3>
														<hr>
															<p>This study attempts to determine the effectivity of Moringa oleifera (MO) leaves as a natural coagulant. Specifically, the study aims to determine the turbidity level of the water that is treated by Moringa oleifera leaves and determine the quantity of MO leaves that will be used to remove turbidity. The researchers predicted that MO leaves are effective coagulant in reducing the turbidity level of water. In addition, MO leaves can completely absorb turbidity in water. Sythetic turbid water was prepared from solid Kaolin powder. MO leaves were oven-dried until excess water was removed afterwards; it was activated by soaking in NaCl solution. Coagulation efficiency test was performed in two batches: (1) using activated MO leaves; and (2) using non-activated MO leaves. The Nephelometric Turbidity Unit (NTU) was identified using Merck SQ Method 113. Based on the result of the testing of Turbidity levels of the samples sent to SGS, the MO leaves werenot able to absorb the turbidity of the sample water hence it worsen the water turbidity as the chlorphyll combines with the solutions. Further test must be employed to determine the complete absorptive capacity of the Moringa oleifera leaves. </p>

															<p>This study focused on the effectiveness of onion (Allium cepa) extract as preservative to galunggong (Decapterus macarellus). The study covers the effects of such a preservative to texture, odor, appearance, taste and overall acceptability. The onion extract was applied on the fish and was placed in a 4 degree Celsius freezer, for 2 and 4 days. During the second and fourth day, the samples were presented to 30 panelists for evaluation using the Likert scale. The translation of scores using a T-test was done after the completion of the test for purpose of statistical analysis. At 0.05 level of significance, the p-values indicates that there is no significant difference between the fresh fish and with 2-day treatment in terms of appearance, odor, texture and the over-all acceptability except for taste. Moreover, the pvalues indicates that there is significant difference between the fresh fish and with 4-day treatment in terms of texture, taste and the over-all acceptability except for the odor and appearance. Results indicated that no chemical and microbial analyses were done in the study. </p>

														<h3> Abstract </h3>
														<hr>
															<p> Political participation is higher among men than women in most parts of the world. As time goes by, more technologies are being developed; women are accepted in the society especially in the politics where the potentials of women can be compared to male politicians. This article studies the perspectives of constituents on how a female politician can handle a given position better than male politicians. With the use of a complete triangulation of techniques via survey, interviews and secondary analysis of data; this study shows that women hold more radical opinions on issues regarding gender equality and being a political entity. These factors have positive impact on women’s participation, and as a result, women often confront a “glass cliff” in which their position in the office is precarious. Results indicated that women now are truly accepted in politics especially here in the Philippines; women are also very cooperative in political exercises in which it increases the support of women politicians here in the Philippines. Also, there was a strong preference for a female politician on the appointment when the seat was described as hard to win.</p>

																<h3>THE POLITICAL CULTURE OF SELECT LETRAN STUDENTS</h3>
														<br>
																											<p><em> Francis Palabay | Prince Aian Villanueva<br>September 24, 2019 <br> Political Science </em></p>
														<br>
														<h3> Abstract </h3>
														<hr>
															<p> When it comes to social and political participation, the youth comes to mind last. The culture of politics amongst students is a shady idea especially in an institution like that of Colegio de San Juan de Letran. In a school setting, social media (websites that create inter-personal relationship), school culture (which can be described as characteristics inherent to the Colegio), and influential people (who may be members of the faculty and seminar guest speakers) are considered as primary influential factors for political orientation due to their accessibility for students while inside the school. Through Fairclough’s critical discourse analysis that examines power relations involved in the discourses available in political forums, this paper describes the political culture of Letran students. As illustrated in this paper, the political culture of Letran students is a collection of characteristics that may as well give the political identity of the Letran student body as a whole: a mixture of tolerant, active-conservative and a democratic political culture.</p>

															<br>
															<h3> Abstract </h3>
															<hr>
																<p>The purpose of this study is to identify the self worth that the people with disabilities have and also to describe the experiences they have encountered. Using purposive sampling, ten Filipinos with physical disabilities from Tahanang Walang Hagdanan are selected as participants. In the selection of the informants, two requirements surfaced: they must be wheelchair bound and all are in their adulthood stage. The researchers used a self- designed questionnaire that is associated with the people with disabilities. It was found in the study that people in general play important roles in society including the people with disabilities. Their disability became a bridge for them to appreciate their lives more. In conclusion, people with disabilities believed that they are more likely to be perceived by able-bodied individuals as pitiful and somehow useless in the society, this perception caused people with disabilities to strive more in achieving something with their lives despite their disability. </p>

																<br>
																<h3> Abstract </h3>
																<hr>
																	<p>The study aimed to determine the self-identity of Filipina breadwinners and the role that the breadwinner position plays in the participants’ identity formation. Twelve Filipina breadwinners, the sole source of their family income, were the participants of the research. The Lovingness, Appreciativeness and Faithfulness (LAF) model of self-identity of the Filipina breadwinner was fashioned based on the findings from the interviews. The study found that single breadwinners are appreciative of the support that their family gave to them when they were younger, thus they want to repay their family by being the breadwinner. Moreover, married breadwinners showed their loving attribute towards their family by being breadwinners. Furthermore, single moms remained faithful to their self-identity in spite ofthe many problems and complications in their breadwinner role. </p>

																<br>
																<h3> Abstract </h3>
																<hr>
																	<p>Despite numerous studies on how Muslims are stereotyped by the media, little is known on how evident and how powerful media could be in influencing and shaping the views of the readers. The overall image of Muslims that remains is that they are highly associated with terrorism and this lingers on, thus creating a notion that this race is a threat to other people, creating further prejudices and misconceptions towards most Muslims. In order to prove whether or not there such stereotyping, this study dealt with the issue through a content analysis of news reports in broadsheets for a period of two months. From three national newspapers all news articles related to Muslims were collected and subjected to categorizations according to their thematic descriptions, news worthiness and positivity or negativity according to the portrayal of Muslims. An analysis of the results showed that the theme of news articles affects the stereotyping of the Muslims and that news worthiness affects stereotyping of the Muslims. Results showed the prevailing topics of the articles, Politics and Terrorism. Broadsheets positioned them in sections according to their value as Banner stories, in Front Pages and in Other Inner News. Negative issues were highlighted more than the positive. Therefore, the researchers concluded that it was palpable even in print media that Muslims were stereotyped. Moreover, the researchers found that this stereotyping would continue as long as the line of thinking of media is mainly to catch the reader’s attention. </p>

																	<br>
																	<h3> Abstract </h3>
																	<hr>
																		<p>This empirical phenomenological study aimed to identify and understand the coping strategies of selected Filipinos victimized by Typhoon Ondoy across lifespan. Specifically, this study intended to (a) determine the lived experiences of the participants pertinent to typhoon Ondoy, (b) identify the coping strategies of the participants, (c) establish an eidetic symbol of the study, and (d) differentiate the coping strategies of selected Filipinos across age groups. The researchers interviewed 15 participants from Marikina City who were victims of typhoon Ondoy. Transcribed interviews were analyzed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. IPA yielded three themes common among participants' lived experiences - (a) Ondoy as a tragic incident, (b) Ondoy as an unusual encounter, and (c) Ondoy as a life changer. Results showed that Filipinos cope by (a) receiving social assistance which can be classified into two sub-themes namely - external aid and support from kin, (b) employing mitigative measures, and (c) turning to faith. Eidetic symbols of the study were also established. Conclusion and limitation are discussed. </p>

																							<h3>POSTMODERN FEMINISM: CONCEPT OF SELECTED FILIPINO WOMEN'S SELF-WORTH</h3>

																		<br>
																		<h3> Abstract </h3>
																		<hr>
																			<p>This study had two intentions. First, it aimed to explore the context of Filipino women's self-worth by concentrating on how they view themselves as a woman. Second, this study was conducted to justify the idea of the “woman of worth” through a postmodern feminist perspective. Essentially, this study supported Covington's Self-worth Theory (2001). Its premise states that the worthiness of an individual is scaled in relation to the achievements he/she gets. This achievement however, does not only pertain to academic status, but also to the fulfilment one gets whenever she contributes for the purpose of success. It was significant that among the respondents, being able to contribute is the ultimate basis of their worth. Apart from their awareness on their own characteristics and on the roles that they play, affirmation from others also enables them to feel empowered as a woman. </p>

																					<h3> Abstract </h3>
																					<hr>
																						<p>This study aimed to establish the adsorption characteristics of coconut husks, in the form of activated carbon in the removal of pharmaceutical products. Equilibrium test was conducted at varying initial concentrations to determine the effect as needed for optimum adsorption. The artificially contaminated wastewater was prepared by spiking pharmaceutical products – Ibuprofen and Paracetamol – in distilled water. Coconut husks were chemically activated by soaking in a 0.01M potassium hydroxide solution (KOH), as dehydrating agent at impregnation ratio of 1:1. Then was oven dried for 3-5 hours at 110 ?C, cooled to room temperature and ground using mortar and pestle. Wasterwaster samples with initial concentration ranging from 200-500 ppm were exposed for 24 hours with the activated cocos nucifera biosorbent. Samples were analyzed via Perkin Elmer Lambda 40 UV Visible Spectrophotometer with the maximum wavelength of 273nm and 248nm, respectively. The results of the analysis showed that coconut husk is not effective biosorbent for pharmaceutical products, particularly Ibuprofen with the adsorption percentage ranging from -14.5% to 14% and relatively low effectiveness in Paracetamol with percentage ranging only from 8% to 38.5%. The equilibrium loading was found to increase as the initial concentration decreases. Although the results displayed a successful process of biosorption of the pharmaceutical residues, that have been tested, especially for Paracetamol, the percentages of adsorption were relatively low as compared to the findings of previous studies. Thus, it cannot be clearly accounted that activated coconut husk is the most appropriate material for the removal of such organic compounds. Moreover, the differences among the concentrations of the samples in the study were limited. This may have impacted the efficiency of the biosorbent to the adsorbate. </p>

																						<h3> Abstract </h3>
																						<hr>
																							<p> Water pollution has been considered a major environmental problem faced by modern society. Presence of contaminants given off by industrial processes like toxic heavy metals have brought serious hazard to the environment and to human health as well. Adsorption, being identified as a principal method used to eliminate heavy metals from aqueous effluents, is considered as the best wastewater treatment method because of its universality while being an easy process. The 2+ present study examined the effectiveness of sugarcane bagasse as biosorbent for the removal of Pb ions in wastewater.Specifically, it identified the effects of varying initial concentration using equilibrium test. Results have shown that the amount of lead adsorbed increases with an increase in initial concentration. The observation is reasonable because +2 increasing the initial concentration of lead increases the gradient of concentration or the driving force of a diffusion of Pb to the mass of the biosorbent. Hence, the percent removal of heavy metals depends on the initial metal ions concentration, thus; decreases with an increase in initial metal ions concentration. Similarly, the difference in percentage removal of different heavy metal ions at the same initial metal ions concentration may be attributed to the difference in their chemical affinity and ion exchange capacity with respect to the chemical functional group on the surface of the adsorbent (Meena, Mishra, Rai, Rajagopal, & Nagar, 2005). 2+ Keywords: Biosorption, Sugarcane, Bagasse,</p>

				<h3> Abstract </h3>
				<hr>
					<p> This study aims to know the lived experiences of battered mothers, how they relate to their children, and respond to the maltreatment of their spouses. we used interpretative phenomenological analysis in analyzing the data. Through purposive sampling, 10 battered mothers, ages 32 to 52 were chosen to be participants in the study. We came up with five themes: sacrificing for their children, anger, sympathy in sorrow, physical pain, and active-passive responses. Mothers, although physically abused, have still shown their love for their children. Hence, they were characterized to be selfless as they can still care for their children despite being battered. They were characterized to be selfless, then. It was shown that they did not want to tolerate the abuse towards them, but their behavior of passively reacting and still staying in the relationship may display tolerance, because again, they were thinking of the their family and their children?s welfare. </p>

								<p><em>Cyrille Ann Gatbonton | Marjorie Zol Mallari | Efraem Janairo<br>September 24, 2019 <br> Psychology </em></p>
					<br>
					<h3> Abstract </h3>
					<hr>
						<p>A study on gender differences in decision-making style of barangay officials was conducted at Lubao, Pampanga. Twelve barangays were selected and the selected barangay officials in each locale were given a test to determine their decision-making styles. The constructs that were observed include rational, dependence, intuitive, avoidant, and spontaneous decision-making styles. A total of 80 participants composed of 40 males and 40 females, answered the questionnaires. The mean values were statistically analyzed using correlation, f-test, and t-test. The only significant difference was obtained on the dependence of the male and female in making decisions. It was observed that the female was more dependent on others when it comes to decision-making. There were no observed differences on other decision-making styles between males and females, suggesting sameness level of rationality, intuition, avoidance, and spontaneity. </p>

											<p><em>Cyrus Ivan Blanco | Silvestre Frando, Jr. | Eleanor Agulto<br>September 24, 2019 <br> Communication </em></p>
						<br>
						<h3> Abstract </h3>
						<hr>
							<p> Native advertising is paid content that matches the look and feel of the digital site where it is placed. This paper sought to determine the influence of celebrity endorsements in native advertising. To attain this objective, qualitative research was employed where selected Twitter followers of Anne Curtis and other celebrity endorsers were interviewed. The opinions, experiences and motivations of individual participants on native advertising in general, and Twitter celebrity endorsements in particular, were probed. The findings revealed that the informants were not receptive to Twitter posts that seemed like obvious advertisements but preferred tweets that sounded natural and personal. They also showed a more positive attitude towards the endorsed brands when the characteristics of the celebrities were in congruence with the products they promoted. They likewise said that the gratifying personal experience of the celebrity endorser with the product imbued the Twitter message with credibility and trustworthiness, and was therefore persuasive.</p>

											<h3>PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT ON THE ADSORPTION OF METHYLENE BLUE DYE IN WASTEWATER USING COCONUT LUMBER SAWDUST</h3>

							<h3> Abstract </h3>
							<hr>
								<p> Color of water is the first indicator of contamination. It is, therefore, necessary to remove contaminants from wastewater before discharging it into water bodies as these are harmful, especially to aquatic life. Dyes from wastewater of textile and dying industries are currently one of the environmental problems, wherein increased concentration of these pollutants poses environmental water degradation. Using adsorption, this study tested the effectiveness of Coconut lumber sawdust, an indigenous waste product, as biosorbent in an artificially prepared methylene blue (MB) dye wastewater. The effect of the different initial concentration was also studied. Coconut lumber sawdust was treated with 0.01 M potassium hydroxide (KOH) and was activated at 1800C for two hours in an oven. The adsorption process included agitation through aeration. Filtered samples were analyzed using Perkin Elmer Lambda 40 UV-Vis spectrophotometer with the maximum wavelength of 665 nm. Results showed that the percent removal of MB using coconut lumber sawdust ranges from 68% to 81% that implies that coconut lumber sawdust is an effective biosorbent of MB. The equilibrium loading was found to increase as the initial concentration increases. The adsorption of MB is primarily because of the activation of the sawdust. During activation, the internal surface of the coconut lumber sawdust becomes more highly developed and extended by controlled oxidation of carbon atoms (Cameron Carbon Inc., 2009). Accessibility of the internal surface area is due to the network of pores opened as the coconut lumber sawdust was activated.</p>

								<h3> Abstract </h3>
								<hr>
									<p>A wide range of pollutants have been affecting soil for the past years. These pollutants have led to major disturbances in communities and populations of soil organisms, as well as their function in the soil ecosystem. Studies have shown that earthworms are considered to be convenient indicators of land use and soil fertility for they are sensitive to toxic chemicals. According to Weltje (1998 as cited in Dai, 2004), “different factors interact to determine the amounts of pollutants accumulated by earthworms. The affinity of metals for soil constituents is the primary element to take into account. The distribution of metals among the soil phases is important for the bioaccumulation by earthworms as the main pathways for chemical absorption are the skin for soluble elements, gut transit and digestion.” This study aims to identify the effectivity of Eudriluseugenae in the bioaccumulation of heavy metals in an artificially contaminated soil and its significant difference in different levels of concentration in each sample. A total mass of 4.3g to 4.5g of 7 starved earthworms exposed for seven days to artificially prepared copper sulfate contaminated soil samples with concentration range of 1000 ppm to 5000 ppm. Soil samples were then tested for copper (Cu2+) ions concentration using Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP). The results showed that there was a range 92-94 percent removal of copper in the contaminated soil which shows the effectivity of Eudriluseugeniae in bioaccumulating heavy metal. This proves that earthworms are important organisms that may enhance the function of the soil ecosystem. It is also to note that higher concentrations may highly increase the chance of greater consumption of heavy metals. </p>

															<h3>INCORPORATION OF SABA (MUSA PARADISIACA) BANANA PEEL IN FRESH PASTA</h3>
									<br>
																		<p><em>Jolina Mae Aguilar | Abe Rose Baria | Christine Cruz<br>September 24, 2019 <br> Natural Sciences </em></p>
									<br>
									<h3> Abstract </h3>
									<hr>
										<p>Saba or Cardaba is one of the locally grown species of banana in the Philippines. It is frequently used in making desserts such as cakes, chips, banana cues, and turon. Oftentimes after using, the saba's peel serves no other purpose and is just thrown away. In this light, this study aims to produce flour from saba peel and use it as partial substitute to semolina flour in generating fresh pasta. In addition, the study aims to identify its nutritive quality through proximate and microbial analysis, its acceptability using 9-point hedonic scale, and its production cost. The saba peel was first dried at 60O C for 8 hours using a cabinet dryer. Afterwards, it was ground, and then mixed with semolina flour in varying saba peel flour to semolina flour percentage (0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% saba peel flour). Using sensory evaluation, it was found out that the fresh pasta with 20% saba peel flour obtained the highest result in terms of aroma, flavor, texture and general acceptability. Consecutively, analysis of the nutritive quality of the freshly cooked pasta showed that the 20% saba peel pasta exhibited higher content of ash (0.88%), moisture (62.4%), total fat (6.4%) and total dietary fiber (0.85% for soluble fiber and 4.9% for insoluble fiber) as compared to the Semolina pasta. Results of the microbial analysis also showed that the pasta was safe to consume. </p>

										<h3> Abstract </h3>
										<hr>
											<p>This study aims to determine the glucosinolate content in Raphanus sativus, and given the potential of a more potent glucosinolate in low temperature, this research will attempt to produce a sorbet that is fortified with radish that has the possibility of being a cancer fighting food source. The variations of glucosinolates that are present in trace amounts in Raphanus sativus were evaluated and identified as isothiocyanates which has a sulfur-containing compound using Clarus 500 Gas Chromatograph. Fifty random panelists were presented 2 variations of sorbet coded as Sample A and Sample B, to be evaluated using a 7-point hedonic scale. Sample A was the controlled sorbet while Sample B was the sorbet with Radish. The translation of scores using simple averaging and ANOVA with regards to the sorbet‘s appearance, taste, odor, texture, and over-all acceptability was done after the test for the purpose of statistical analysis. Based on the results, glucosinolates such as sulfur-contaning compound have been found present in Raphanus sativus. The structures of all of the identified glucosinolates such as isothiocyanates products of myrosinase hydrolysis were confirmed by GC/MC. Translation of scores of the sensory evaluation using simple averaging for statistical analysis of the 7-point hedonic scale shows that the appearance and texture of the control sorbet are higher than the Radish sorbet but they are not significantly different. While the taste, odor and general acceptability of the control is found to be significantly higher compared to the Radish sorbet. </p>

																						<p><em>Jenika Asuncion | Denise Peji | Angeline Martha Beroin<br>September 24, 2019 <br> Psychology </em></p>
										<br>
										<h3> Abstract </h3>
										<hr>
											<p>Suicide is becoming a global phenomenon with the increasing cases, particularly among adolescents. With these occurrences, parents experience bereavement, left in state of grief and uncertainty. This study aimed to broaden the understanding of the lived experiences of parents who have lost a child through suicide. Eight (8) parents who have been suicide-bereaved for 2 to 5 years have participated through face-to-face interviews. After transcribing and categorizing the significant statements from the interview transcription, two essential themes emerged from the data: The Aftermath of Losing a Child and Experiencing the Meaning of Loss. These themes provide a deeper understanding of their experiences of loss, from the moment of losing their child, to after the incident, and the meaning of loss for them since the death of their child up to the present. These findings place emphasis on the grief process of suicide bereavement, as they continue life as a parent. Additionally, these themes provide a realization of the significance of this phenomenon from the parents‘ perspective. </p>

																			<h3>A STUDY ON THE PHILIPPINE ANTI-MAIL-ORDER BRIDE ACT OF 1990</h3>
										<br>
																								<p><em>Monica Shane Iqbal | Atty. Ronald Brian Evangelista<br>September 24, 2019 <br> Political Science </em></p>
										<br>
										<h3> Abstract </h3>
										<hr>
											<p> Under Philippine laws, the Mail-Order Bride (MOB) Phenomenon is a mechanism of human-trafficking. However, the Philippines remains to be the top exporter of MOBs in Asia. And the presence of advancements in Information and Communication Technology (ICTs) seem to have given Marriage Brokers (exploiters) a way to circumvent the law, specifically by the operations of such exploiters. This research aimed to determine if there is a need to amend Republic Act 6955 (RA 6955), otherwise known as the Philippine Anti-Mail-Order Bride Act (PAMOBA) of 1990 through qualitative examination of the effect of advancements in ICTs in its implementation based on the interviews of stakeholders (experts). The narratives were grouped by themes and analyzed through the use of a dendrogram. Stakeholders claim that ICTs are helpful in both the implementation of programs that augment the law and the operations of the MOB. The results ascertain that the advancements of ICTs affect both the operations of exploiters and the stakeholders— that it had helped the sophistication of operations of exploiters, and had helped the stakeholders and victims in the identification and subsequent prosecution of exploitation as well as to strengthen the fight against human-trafficking via this mechanism.</p>

															<h3>NUTRITIONAL POTENTIAL OF COIX LACRYMA-JOBI L. (ADLAI) AS A CEREAL BASED MILK DRINK</h3>
														<br>
															<p><em>Cyril Jerome Manning | Christine Cruz | Robby Raven Navarro <br>September 24, 2019 <br> Natural Sciences </em></p>
														<br>
														<h3> Abstract </h3>
														<hr>
															<p>In the recent years, Adlai has been a focus of the Department of Agriculture – Bureau of Agricultural Research (DA – BAR) in the Philippines in the aspect of research and development because of its versatility and nutritional value. Adlai (Coix lacryma-jobi L.) is a grass based cereal crop that is rich in starch, vitamins and minerals. It may be a substitute for rice and corn as a potential staple food in the Philippines. This study aims to utilize Adlai as a source of Lactose-free Cereal drink, specifically (1) to evaluate the over-all acceptability of Adlai cereal based milk drink using 9-point Hedonic Scale. Also, to (2) determine the proximate analysis and Total Dietary Fiber (TDF) content of Adlai cereal based milk drink. Lastly, to (3) determine the product cost of Adlai cereal based milk drink. Adlai Milk and sweetener were tested for formulation (0, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%) and were subjected to sensory evaluation. The best formulation based on the sensory evaluation was analyzed at Sentrotek in Mandaluyong City for Proximate Analysis and test for TDF. Adlai Milk yielded 13.9g Carbohydrates, 0.02g Ash, 86.1g Moisture, 12g Sugars as Invert and 0.02g TDF per 100ml Adlai Milk while protein and fat were 0.0g per 100ml Adlai Milk. It is concluded that among the samples, formulation with ratio 20 grams of sugar: 80 ml raw Adlai cereal based milk drink was the most acceptable for all the panelists. This formulation showed a significant number of total carbohydrates and energy (kcal). However, there were no detected protein and fat, and a decreased TDF in the milk. Moreover, compared to commercial cereal-based milk drink, Adlai cereal based milk drink is cost-efficient. </p>

															<h3> Abstract </h3>
															<hr>
																<p>It is one of the pivotal roles of the government to ensure food safety and sanitation among its people. Food safety refers to the conditions and practices that preserve the quality of food to prevent contamination. A Food Establishment’s Sanitary Permit is a way to prove that there is Food Safety. This study aims to determine the issues encountered by the Manila Health Department in implementing such policy and to describe the process of securing a sanitary permit. In the effort to discover whether the MHD is effective in implementing its policy, the researcher conducted focused interviews among MHD Officials and Samahan ng mga Nagkakaisang Manininda ng Intramuros members & non-members. The study revealed that though the Manila Health Department is doing its best efforts to ensure Food Safety within its jurisdiction, still there are lapses in both parties which result to the hindrance of the effectiveness of the said PD in the locale. </p>

																<h3> Abstract </h3>
																<hr>
																	<p>This study identifies the tourists’ motivational patterns in coming to Fort Santiago at the levels of attribute, consequence and values based on means-end chain (MEC) theory. This quantitative study and data were gathered, using the multi-aspect researcher-made instrument (Cronbach Alpha Test=0.94). Respondents were first made to fill in a robotfoto for purposes of profiling their baseline characteristics. They were later asked to rate the listed indicators, using the 8-point Likert Scale. Using statistical tools such as factor analysis and ANOVA, mean and standard deviation, data were treated in-depth. Factor analysis of the respondents’ travel motivational patterns yielded six significant dimensions, namely: Exploration Reasons, GetAway Reasons, Snowball Reasons, Snapshot Reasons, Cookie-cutter Reasons, and Site Reasons. Results of the study show that seeing Reducto San Francisco Javier, watching a film of Intramuros in the chambers of Baluartillo de San Francisco Javier and seeing the Memorial Cross are some of the features that motivate most of the respondents to Fort Santiago. Further, marketing and product development implications are provided to help attract this emerging market of Fort Santiago. </p>

																													<p><em>Angeline Martha Beroin | Alyzza Mae Encabo | Sharmel Ann Krizza Manuel<br>September 24, 2019 <br> Psychology</em></p>
																		<br>
																		<h3> Abstract </h3>
																		<hr>
																			<p>Infidelity causes damages that may result to tragedies such as breaking of families, divorce, physical violence, and emotional distress to the non-participating partner. This emotional distress may lead to destruction of the non-participating partner’s self-esteem, self-worth, and feel overwhelming emotions like guilt and rejection. Hence, this traumatic experience of infidelity may also end up positively for the non-participating partner. The emotional distress may become a source of positive psychological changes or posttraumatic growth (PTG). Thus, this PTG of non-participating partners may change their perspective toward their negative experience from infidelity. With this, the study aims to describe the posttraumatic growth of the male non-participating partners through their lived experiences in the aftermath of the traumatic incident, infidelity. This paper also included the factors that contributed to the growth of the male non-participating partners who experienced infidelity. Using purposive sampling, the data were collected through one-on-one interviews with the eight participants using semi-structured interview questions. The data gathered were analyzed using thematic analysis which is usually used in qualitative researches for identifying, analyzing, and reporting of the themes or patterns of the data. </p>

																									<h3>THE MEDIATING ROLE OF POST TRAUMATIC GROWTH IN PREDICTING GENERALIZED GRATITUDE OF RESILIENT PWDS</h3>
																		<br>
																														<p><em>Louie Benedict Ignacio | Rosela Bautista | Patrick Joseph Lapuz | Renz Louis Montano<br>September 24, 2019 <br> Psychology</em></p>
																		<br>
																		<h3> Abstract </h3>
																		<hr>
																			<p>Disability affects the daily living of an individual including relationship, school and work. Psychological health of a person with disability can affect their perception or experience of disability. The question in this study is if PWD’s still experience generalized gratitude despite of their status in life as PWD. The study investigated the Mediating role of Posttraumatic growth in predicting generalized gratitude of resilient PWDS. In the context of the present study, resilience is experienced after a negative incident in the individual‘s life. This becomes a spring board for the understanding the process of experiencing gratitude through resilience. The researchers have two hypotheses in the study; first is resilience predicts generalized gratitude and the second is posttraumatic growth mediates the relationship of resilience and generalized gratitude. Mediation analysis was used in understanding the relationship of resilience and gratitude. Seventy-eight people who have acquired disability participated in the study. Twenty-three (23) participants were gathered from Bahay Biyaya and 45 participants were from Tahanang Walang Hagdanan Inc., 1 from Sinag Tala and 9 respondents were not associated with any foundation. The respondents were asked to complete the questionnaire that contains the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), followed by the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI), and then finally the GQ-6 Short Form (GQ-6). Results show that resilience does predict gratitude and PTG does mediate the relationship of the two. Thus, supporting the hypotheses, the present study shows that resilience does affect the PWDs feeling grateful despite their negative experiences. Resilience is not the only thing that keeps them feel grateful but also growth and finding meaning to their experiences following disability. This proves theoretically that the Dynamic Model of Adjustment of Individuals Living with Chronic Disease or Disability how Filipino PWD’s shows gratitude after traumatic experience. </p>

																			<h3> Abstract </h3>
																			<hr>
																				<p>This research explores the possibility of fear appeal (emotional response to the presence of a danger or threat) having a relationship with brand awareness and purchase intention. The proponents use Safeguard, which has been the number one soap brand in the Philippines for decades, and its “Pamilya On Guard” commercial, which was directed to help mothers in protecting their families from getting germs and from getting sick. Through a survey questionnaire given to 400 mothers from Barangay Tatalon in Quezon City, the mothers’ purchase intentions towards Safeguard as a brand are rated with the uses of multiple choice, yes or no questions and a four-point Likert scale. Brand awareness and fear appeal are also measured through frequencies and the Spearman rho correlations. The study reveals that while the mothers from Tatalon, Quezon City are aware of the said brand and have the intent to purchase, and the aforementioned commercial has fear appeal, that there is no significant relationship between the three variables. The researchers conclude that there should be a proper utilization of the message and other advertising appeal formats should be applied since it is found that fear appeal has no impact to the mothers of Tatalon, Quezon City. </p>

																						<h3> Abstract </h3>
																						<hr>
																							<p>With the high turnover rates and resignations, companies are in need of employees with excellent skills and capabilities, along with expanded knowledge and experiences that would commit to the organization. In relation to that speculation, excellent and superb employees are now as rare as a diamond with increasing needs and wants. This study aims to find the significant effect of benefits package on the commitment and job performance of the employees to the organization. 100 respondents participated in the fulfillment of the study. The gender of the respondents was considered with a result of 50.0% males and 50.0% females. The highest percentage on the age bracket was from 21 - 25 years old, interpreting those respondents were in their mid-twenties. On the educational attainment, 57.0 % of the respondents were college undergraduates. The SPSS statistical tool was used to process the data gathered. The regression analysis model proved three (3) hypothesis with the application of Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory of Motivation: (1) Benefits package has a moderate impact to the commitment of the employees to their organization; (2) Organizational Commitment does not entirely affect the performance or productivity of the employees in terms of their responsibilities; and (3) Benefits have a much greater effect on the job performance of the employees. As a conclusion, this study may become vital information to the companies by asserting the importance of every factor considered for the Human Resource decision making for recruitment. </p>

																																													<p><em>Nolan Joseph De Los Santos | Divina Alexandra Maat | Adaya Izebel Ventura<br>September 24, 2019 <br> Natural Sciences</em></p>
																								<br>
																								<h3> Abstract </h3>
																								<hr>
																									<p>There is an increase need for food product development due to the continuing age in consumers’ interests and demands. Sweet potato (SP), a common root crop in the Philippines, is commonly used as food crop and is usually eaten boiled or fried. The roots, stems and leaves of SP have been utilized for different food products such as jam, flour and animal feeds. This study aims to utilize the tuberous root of orange sweet potato variety into ketchup. Raw orange sweet potato (OSP) and the developed ketchup were subjected to proximate, total dietary fiber, Vitamin A analysis, physicochemical and microbiological analysis. The proximate analysis of the ketchup showed that OSP ketchup is a poor source of protein (0.53g/100g) and fat (none-detected). However, the ash content increased (2.1g/100g) and there is a decrease of carbohydrate content (18.77g/100g) due to the process of boiling. On the other hand, the moisture increased (78.6g/100g) due to addition and absorption of more water. The presence of the dietary fiber and vitamin A (2.8g/100g and 15.6 µgRE/100g, respectively) contributes to the nutritional composition of the OSP ketchup. The physicochemical analysis showed that titratable acidity particularly citric acid (0.54 %w/v) inhibits the microbial growth while water activity content (0.936 Aw) showed that the product is susceptible to microbial growth. The viscosity (58,980 cp) and pH (4.11 %w/v) is within the standard showing that it possesses the qualities of ketchup. However the total soluble solids (13.1%w/v) can still be improved. The sensory evaluation of the SP ketchup showed that majority of the panellist scored 7 (like moderately) means that OSP ketchup is acceptable. The microbial analysis showed that SP ketchup complied with the standards and could be considered safe. The result of this study has proved that sweet potato could be utilized and developed into a variety of food product like ketchup. </p>

																													<h3>DEVELOPMENT OF SPRAY-DRIED POWDERED KAMIAS (AVERRHOA BILIMBI LINN.)</h3>
																									<br>
																																															<p><em>Christine Cruz | Czarina Ramirez | Ingrid Singian<br>September 24, 2019 <br> Natural Sciences</em></p>
																									<br>
																									<h3> Abstract </h3>
																									<hr>
																										<p>Underutilized fruits contain phytochemical substances that have promising health effects on humans. The need to make these fruits commercially available is still on progress and research on them is of little importance. Averrhoa bilimbi or also known as kamias is an indigenous fruit that is cultivated semi-wild everywhere in South East Asia including the Philippines. Spray drying is a drying technique wherein a liquid or slurry feed is turned into a dry powder. Fruit juice powder is widely accepted for human consumption and is a good alternative to convenient and healthy food products. This study aims to develop an instant powdered Kamias fruit juice drink using spray-drying technique. Sensory evaluation, proximate, physicochemical, vitamin C and microbiological analysis were conducted. Seventy-five (75) untrained panelists evaluated the four formulations of fruit juice which are control (100% extract), kamias powder with 30% gum arabic, kamias powder with 30% maltodextrin and kamias powder with 15% maltodextrin and 15% gum arabic (mixed carriers). It was evaluated according to the five sensory attributes using 9-point hedonic scale. Kamias powdered juice with 30% maltodextrin was considered the best formulation by means of sensory evaluation. Proximate analysis has yielded 3.08-4.70% moisture, 0.31-0.84% fat, 1.13-2.52% protein, 0.14-2.85% ash and 90.83-93.72% carbohydrates content of the four formulations. Physicochemical analysis such as pH, TSS, Bulk Density and aw was also done with a result of 2.54-4.05, 84.31-95.03°B, 0.32-0.42g/ml, and 0.19-0.30, respectively. Vitamin C content of the kamias powders significantly decreased. Kamias powder with 30% Gum Arabic has retained the highest amount of Vitamin C among the three powdered samples. Microbial analysis of the best formulation resulted in negative presence of coliform count and yeast and mold while total plate count was 6x102cfu/g. The encapsulation method using maltodextrin and gum arabic as carriers showed different physical, chemical and sensorial properties. The encapsulation of core material was successful to retain considerable amounts of vitamin C. </p>

						<h3> Abstract </h3>
						<hr>
							<p> Political Culture (PC) according to Tepper (2010) refers to the pattern of beliefs and assumptions ordinary people have towards the world, as these pertain to politics, and it opened a huge picture of how it affects the political participation (PP) of every nation especially the partake of our Indigenous People (IP). The research determined how the Political Culture of the tribe member of Agta tribe and how it affects their Political Participation to the state politics, and identified the Agtas in Alabat, Quezon regarding their awareness of their rights as Indigenous People (IP) like the Right to suffrage. This study assesses as well the IP’s knowledge and understanding of the society and theirattitude towards their stand about the contemporary issues and, identify their practices inside their tribes. However, Pilipinolohiya (Filipinology) Theory was used to know the culture of the respondents from “within” and bounded by the Filipino centric viewpoint, using narrative method and interview guide question, revealed that the Indigenous People (IP) of Alabat even though their Political Culture is slowly fading, their qualification is still bounded on the characteristics that they are aiming to have as a leader in their traditional manner even the effects of modernization. Furthermore, they are aiming to reinstate, enrich and preserved their culture. The findings recommended that the government should act for them to be placed on one community it will help them to attain their goals of having a well-preserved culture. </p>

								<h3>NANUNUNGKULAN AS LEVIATHAN: A STUDY ON CHILDREN-IN-CONFLICT WITH THE LAW “PRISON” ORGANIZATION IN RELATION TO THOMAS HOBBES' SOCIAL CONTRACT THEORY</h3>
							<br>
								<p><em> Cerynna Gabrielle Gonzales | Sherman Louis Gabito<br>September 24, 2019 <br> Political Science</em></p>
							<br>
							<h3> Abstract </h3>
							<hr>
								<p>States have been dealing with different methods to approach juvenile delinquency specifically how to stop Children in Conflict with the Law (CICL) from re-offending. This study discovered a possible way to address this issue, especially to states adopting a treatment-based program. The purpose of this research is to have an in-depth study about the prison organization called Nanunungkulan / leaders composed of CICL in Manila Youth Reception Center (MYRC). By which, the said prison organization was explained through Thomas Hobbes Social Contract Theory. This study also identified the relationship of the Nanunungkulan to the CICL submissive to them and the outcome of such submission once the CICL were released. This has been done by interviewing released CICL, the Social Welfare Officer Head, and Thomas Hobbes ex-perts to relate the experience of CICL to state of nature, leviathan, and social contract. This showed that the CICL subjects were at first, abso-lutely violent because the SWOs by law cannot harm them. Until such time CICL became fearful yet submissive to the Nanunungkulan or leaders who instill discipline and order inside through violent punishment. The released CICL obeyed the leaders' rules and orders for their own safety/protection and own good from the proved violence inside. The violence in MYRC portrays Thomas Hobbes' state of nature, the prison organization or Nanunungkulan acts as the Leviathan, and the submission of the CICL subjects as the social contract. The outcome of the said process greatly helped the Released CICL. Thus, the researcher recommends that the presence of leaders in Youth detention homes should be considered with violence to be observed. </p>

								<h3> Abstract </h3>
								<hr>
									<p>According to World Health Organization (2015), malnutrition is a prevalent public health issue worldwide, predominantly among elders. With this, the study aims to assess the nutritional status of the elders residing in Barangay 655, Intramuros, Manila and their dietary pattern, to calculate and compare for the macronutrient component of their food intake with the recommended intake designed by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute, Philippines (FNRI) and the relationship between Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) score to the total consumption of each macronutrient component of the food. Lastly, to create food-based dietary guidelines for the elders. MNA was used to determine their nutritional status and estimated food record and FFQ was used to determine their food intake. The results showed that the elders residing in the barangay are mostly at risk of malnutrition and malnourished individuals. Food intakes are found to be inadequate. Nutritional status has a positive -moderate relationship to carbohydrates, positive but weak relationship to protein and negative and weak relationship to fats. Low carbohydrate intake is the main cause of malnutrition among the elders in the barangay. Based on the findings of the current study, the researchers produced dietary guidelines that will help improve their nutritional status. </p>

										<h3>DEVELOPMENT OF NUTRITIONAL POWDERED SEASONING USING SELECTED PHILIPPINE VEGETABLE</h3>
									<br>
													<p><em>Christine Cruz | Lea May Araneta | Denille Manalang<br>September 24, 2019 <br> Natural Sciences</em></p>
									<br>
									<h3> Abstract </h3>
									<hr>
										<p> Micronutrient deficiency is a widespread issue in all ages among developing countries. In order to address this, great interest in supplements from blends of natural herbs and spices has been given because of the health benefits they confer. With this, the study aimed to develop a powdered nutrient supplement out of locally available vegetables in the market and to identify presence of nutrients after undergoing convective drying and cryogenic grinding. The fresh vegetables have undergone drying and grinding to obtain a powdered vegetable. The samples were then analyzed for proximate properties which consist of moisture content, ash, fat, carbohydrates, and protein content. Mineral analysis (sodium, iron, and calcium) was also conducted. Moreover, the total plate count was observed for biological activity. It was found out that the powdered vegetable is high in beta-carotene with traces of minerals like calcium and iron. The sodium content was low compared to the commercially available supplements. From this study, we can conclude that the powdered vegetable supplement has a potential in substituting the commercially available seasonings in the market which has more sodium with less vitamin and mineral content.</p>

										<h3> Abstract </h3>
										<hr>
											<p> This study focuses on the assessment of the nutritional knowledge, dietary habits, sociodemographic information and anthropometric data of the selected collegiate athletes from volleyball, taekwondo, track n’ field, table tennis, lawn tennis, swimming and badminton and collegiate non-athletes within the age bracket of 19-24 years old, and to develop nutritional guidelines for athletes, only. This present study aims to evalu- ate the nutrition knowledge and dietary habits of the collegiate athletes and non-athletes. Specifically, to assess the anthropometric data, compare the nutrition knowledge and dietary habits of the collegiate athletes and non-athletes and develop a nutrition guidelines booklet that focuses on nutritional needs of the collegiate athletes. The number of respondents were 148 students composed of 74 collegiate athletes (37 male and 37 female) and 74 collegiate non-athletes (37 male and 37 female). The gathered anthropometric data includes the weight, height and body mass index or BMI. A questionnaire was used to gather the data of the socio-demographic information, dietary habits and nutritional knowledge of the respondents. Non-athletes (48.19±4.01) had higher means score than athletes (46.08±4.10) which considered as statistically significant (p<0.05). Collegiate non-athletes (87.70±4.26) has the higher nutrition knowledge than athletes (83.66±8.28) which were considered has high significant difference (p<0.05). The results revealed that the collegiate non-athletes has better nutrition knowledge and dietary habits than the collegiate athletes both female and male in Letran-Manila. Proper counselling with nutrition experts and monitoring of nutrition status and dietary needs of the athletes should be done throughout the year not just prior to competition, it must be before, during and after the intense training and exercise of the athletes either by the sports nutritionist or nutrition experts of the college.</p>

											<h3> Abstract </h3>
											<hr>
												<p>Philippines possesses a rich source of banana plants enough to provide us with its many uses. The banana peels have been used for their property of producing a substantial amount of ethanol; however, their efficacies against Staphylococcus aureus have not been studied. The present investigation involved the study of antimicrobial activity of ethanol from banana (Musa acuminate) peels against S. aureus. In the present study, banana peel waste were subjected into two phases – ethanol production and anti-microbial susceptibility testing. In producing ethanol, Musa acuminate peels were gathered and underwent pre-treatment before going through fermentation. Two samples were conditioned at a temperature of 30 °C and the pH value was set to 5.0–5.5. The samples underwent fermentation process for seven days and three days, respectively, by the culture of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The ethanol product from the banana peels was distillated using a distillation apparatus and two samples of 10mL and 8mL ethanol were extracted. The ethanol extract of Musa acuminate was investigated for antimicrobial activity at 100 µg/ml concentrations by using disc diffusion method against gram positive Staphylococcus aureus. After the 24- hour incubation, the zone of inhibition was compared with standard antibiotics ciproflaxin (100 µg/ mL) for comparing the results obtained with. Against the first sample of ethanol extract, Staphylococcus aureus showed a higher inhibition zone of 9 mm, whereas for the second sample, Staphylococcus aureus showed a lesser inhibition zone of about 5 mm. It was then observed that ethanol extract of Musa acuminate was potent against the S. aureus bacteria. </p>

																			<p><em> Jomathan Evan Andaya | Eljhon Capili | Jon Arvin Peguit | Benjamin Tiongson | Kim Hubert Enrile <br>September 24, 2019 <br> Information Technology</em></p>
											<br>
											<h3> Abstract </h3>
											<hr>
												<p>In the Philippines, one of the solutions to energy theft from utilities involves the relocation of electric meters to elevated metering centers, away from the residential building. The length of the service conductorshad made it vulnerable to illegal connections. The proposed solution is a system with theft recognition and magnitude determination mechanisms. The two mechanisms work based on voltage and energyreadings. The system was designed and tested using a residential building-rated microcontroller-based prototype utilizing an energy monitor as input device and the ZigBeeprotocol for wireless communication. The sensitivity, specificity, and success rate of the recognition mechanism were all 100 percent. The percent error of the theft magnitude determination mechanism ranged from 0 to 2.17 percent. Through cost-benefit analysis, the system was found to have positive net benefit at theft probabilities higher than 3.94 percent. The system has excellent usability as assessed though System Usability Scale. </p>

												<h3>V-TROUGH REFLECTORS USING OPEN-LOOP SINGLE AXIS SOLAR TRACKING FOR A PV MODULE</h3>
												<br>
												<p><em> Symon Mykell Andres | John Royce Jamilla | Reden Loyola | Neil Francine Molina | Carlito Gutierrez  <br>September 24, 2019 <br> Information Technology</em></p>
												<br>
												<h3> Abstract </h3>
												<hr>
												<p>Because of its geographical advantage, the Philippines is one of the countries with the highest potential in solar energy harnessing. At present, the solar industry utilizes solar trackers for large scale applications but not in small scale due to their uneconomical prices relative to the financial capability of consumers. Thus, small scale applications only make use of static solar panels. This study intends to link the gap between the presently available technology to small-scale consumers and the integration of both solar tracking and concentrating photovoltaics (CPVs) into a PV module to harness more power. V-trough solar reflectors were programmed to follow the sun based on algorithms set by NREL. A bypass mechanism was also included to protect the system from detrimental temperature levels. The device was tested based on the accuracy of the reflector inclination angles, significance of the increase in the output power and the cost-benefit analysis based on consumer perspective. The error in the inclination angles were found to be minimal, the increase in power output was significant and the device has an annual return of investment of 17.04% within a payback period of 5.83 years. </p>

													<h3> Abstract </h3>
													<hr>
														<p>Banana is one of the most important fruit crop grown in the Philippines in terms of production due to its high demand, nutritive value and affordability. Its fruit can be consumed in variety of forms and processed into chips, jams, jellies, powder and flour, which results to adverse waste generation that pollutes the environment. Thus, this study aimed to utilize its peel in the aspect of food application, specifically in extracting pectin, an ingredient used as thickener, stabilizer, emulsifier and gelling agent in foods. Pectin from saba peel was extracted using microwave assisted extraction (3 pH, 700 W, 128 sec). The extracted pectin had undergone characterization and based from the results, it has 6.08% ash, 1315.79 equivalent weight and 8.06% methoxyl content indicating that it has a good ability ingel forming, jelly-forming and water dispersability, respectively. Its moisture content (5.07%) was significantly low, thus, its quality is protected due to inhibition of microbial growth and pectinase enzyme production. The degree of esterification of extracted pectin (77.38%) has shown that it is a high-ester pectin and is classified rapid-set. However, the pectin has low purity, with possible presence of protein, starch and sugars, as the value of total anhydrouronic acid (59.14%). In terms of safety assessment, the lead was not detected while the standard plate count and yeast and molds were found to be negative. </p>

																					<h3>ANG EKSPLORASYON NG MGA KONSEPTO NG DANGAL AT PURI BATAY SA PANANAW NG MGA PILIPINO</h3>
																<br>

																<h3> Abstract </h3>
																<hr>
																	<p>Layunin: Ang pananaliksik na ito ay gumamit ng qualitative approach upang malaman ang malinaw na kaugnayan ng mga konsepto ng dangal at puri. Metodo: 140 Pilipino na may edad 18 at pataas ang naging kalahok ng pag-aaral na ito. Ang 128 ay sumagot ng Thought Listing Questionnaire habang ang 12 naman ay sumailalim sa Ginabayang Talakayan. Ang audio recording ng ginabayang talakayan ay itinala at ginamitan ng tematikong pagsusuri. Lagom: Tatlong pangunahing tema ang umusbong para sa dangal, dalawa para sa puri at isang pangunahing tema para sa integrasyon ng dalawa. Sa dangal, napag-alamang malaki ang nagiging kontribusyon ng mga pamantayan sa lipunan habang ang sa puri naman ay kasarian na parehong hinubog ng kulturang kinagisnan sa Pilipinas. Bukod pa roon, ang pagkakaroon ng antas ng dangal, puri at digni- dad ay lumitaw din. Puri ang tinukoy na nasa pinaka panlabas habang ang dignidad ang nasa pinaka-panloob. Ang dangal ay nagsisilbing tagapamagitan ng dalawang naunang konsepto. Parehong naaapektuhan ng panlabas na salik ang puri at dangal ngunit sa usapin ng dangal, nakasalalay pa rin sa tao kung paano niya ipoproseso ang pananaw ng ibang tao habang ang sa puri ay tuwirang kontrolado ng ibang tao. Ang dignidad ang lumabas na nasa pinakaloob ng isang indibidwal kung saan tanging ang sarili lamang ang maaaring makaapekto nito. </p>

																<br>
																<h3> Abstract </h3>
																<hr>
																	<p> The main objective of this research was to determine how the crime of offending religious feelings was applied and how it created an imbal- ance in the practice of free expression and religious freedom. This involved a survey of jurisprudence pertaining to the crime of offending religious feelings, and a review of how the latter affected theof practice free expression and religious freedom. This contains cases on how freedom of expres- sion and religious freedom were practiced in the Philippine setup; how the crime of offending religious feelings caused an imbalance applying the “Defamations of Religions” theory and the abuse of rights doctrine. Qualitative data from offenders of the crime of offending religious feelings, high ranking religious persons, and criminal law experts were gathered from interviews. The study concluded what constitutes as notoriously offensive to religious feelings and the mechanics of the crime of offending religious feelings based on an analysis of cases and jurisprudence and the perceptions of law practitioners. It was also concluded that the crime of offending religious feelings limited free expression in a way that it does not get abused.</p>

																	<h3> Abstract </h3>
																	<hr>
																		<p>Self-worth is widely discussed momentarily in different domains. This study aims to know the involvement of environment specifically in fulfilling with the presence of trials, judgments, achievements that will serve as encouragement in gaining self-worth of fishermen. For good meas- ure and profound understanding about self-worth, researchers conducted a semi-structured interview. Findings suggest through descriptive phe- nomenology that there are levels in achieving the self-worth of fishermen such as self-advocacy wherein they develop their individuality. Followed by self-identity in which they recognize their selves with the influence of others and lastly, self-actualization where they feel valued by achieving something that will give them satisfaction. It was determined that achieving and providing for their family are something that a fishermen’s self- worth measures. Briefly, the research conducted can not only aid forthcoming researchers interested in the field of self-worth but also providing a fill in the gap of knowledge in this phenomenon. </p>

																					<h3>EMOTION DYSREGULATIONS AS MEDIATOR ON THE RELATIONSHIP OF PERFECTIONISM AND SUICIDAL DESIRE</h3>
																		<br>
																								<p><em>Angeline Martha Beroin | Rhianna Charleen Bacal<br>September 24, 2019 <br> Psychology </em></p>
																		<br>
																		<h3> Abstract </h3>
																		<hr>
																			<p>Suicide cases have been prevalent in college students nowadays. The high standards placed upon them by society or themselves contribute to an individual’s suicidal desire. Perfectionists tend to have deficits in emotion regulation and emotionally dysregulated individuals have higher risks for suicidal desire. This study provides an analysis and evaluation of how emotion dysregulation mediates the relationship of perfectionism and suicidal desire. A survey was conducted among 200 college students. Mediation analysis using Model 4 of the Conditional Process Analysis by Hayes and Sobel test was used to analyze the data. Results of the data show that all relationships are significant. In particular, perfectionism was found to be a predictor of suicidal desire. Moreover, emotion dysregulation partially mediates between perfectionism and suicidal desire. The study finds that college students have high standards for themselves and failure to achieve these may lead to suicidal desire. The study also finds that college students do not regulate their emotions well when not meeting their standards which may lead to a person’s suicidal desire. </p>

																						<h3>DEVELOPMENT OF VITAMIN A - RICH PASTA USING RICE BRAN FLOUR AS PARTIAL SUBSTITUTE TO WHEAT FLOUR</h3>
																		<br>
																										<p><em>Christine Cruz | Lindsay Giagonia | Alexis Ailyn Reyes<br>September 24, 2019 <br> Natural Sciences </em></p>
																		<br>
																		<h3> Abstract </h3>
																		<hr>
																			<p>Micronutrient deficiencies are a continual lack of nutritional vitamins and minerals and constitute a huge public health problem. Vitamin A deficiency increases vulnerability to a variety of illnesses which includes diarrhoea, measles, and respiratory infections where it is common amongst children. In order to address this, great interest in rice bran has led in the discovery of various health benefits. With this, the study aimed to develop a pasta using the rice bran as partial substitute to wheat flour and to determine the Vitamin A content of the rice bran pasta in comparison to commercially available pasta. The rice bran has undergone dry heating method at 130°C for 20 minutes and was formed into dough. The sample pasta was then analyzed for proximate analysis which consists of moisture content, ash, carbohydrates, protein, fat and crude fiber. Vitamin A content analysis was also conducted. Moreover, aerobic plate count, yeast and mold count was observed for microbial activity. It was found out that the rice bran pasta is high in Vitamin A showing a high content of 188 µgRE/100g which is 47% of the recommended dietary allowance compared to the commercially available pasta. Researchers recommend developing a rice bran pasta that should be cut and shaped into different sizes, undergo further tests with different ratios of rice bran flour and can be used for supplementary feedings in the community.From this study, it can be concluded that rice bran is safe for human consumption and can be used as a food supplement. </p>

																			<br>
																			<h3> Abstract </h3>
																			<hr>
																			<p> Watermelon rind is considered as a major solid waste in the Philippines due to the high consumption of watermelon pulp. It is said to contain at least 13% of pectin. Pectin is used as a gelling agent for jam and jellies. This study aims to extract pectin from watermelon rind and to characterize the extracted pectin to determine the pectin yield, equivalent weight, methoxyl content, total anhydrouronic acid content and degree of esterification. The watermelon rind was dried using a cabinet dryer at 50°C for 24hrs before conducting the extraction. The extraction of the pectin was conducted using microwave assisted extraction (pH 2, 700 W, 158 sec). The extracted coagulated pectin was characterized obtaining the following results: pectin yield (.17%), equivalent weight (192.31), methoxyl content (1.18%), total anhydrouronic acid content (15.84%) and degree of esterification (0.42%). Based on the results obtained, it shows that watermelon rind has a low content of pectin. </p>

																			<h3> Abstract </h3>
																			<hr>
																				<p> The world consumes about a million plastic bottles a minute, with the Philippines as one of the top plastic polluters. It is currently one of the many crises that the Philippines is experiencing. Using plastic bottles in designing a reinforced concrete beam is one of the many examples in the modernization of sustainable structures. An alternative for traditional construction materials is the key point, thus, this study incorporated the use of bamboo fibers as reinforcement in replacement of steel which is known for its high cost. Bamboo is known for its low-cost, wide availability and it is well known for its diverse properties. This research intends to investigate the flexural capacity of bamboo reinforced plastic bottle concrete beams for low-cost housing, determine the potential of this model in the field of construction, and analyze its effect on cost. </p>

																			<h3> Abstract </h3>
																			<hr>
																				<p> As the technology invades our homes, the chance of electrical fires happening increased over recent years. The study, Smart Adaptor is the solution suited in preventing those fires with simple home automation using smart adaptor system which transforms traditional appliances at home into a smart one. It was focused on creating a device to be added to the home appliances that is efficient, reliable and accurate and helped on lessening fire breakouts due to electronic malfunction. The device was tested in two households in Brgy. 150 Tondo, Manila wherein the device was used in two weeks span. The three main components were examined wherein the PIR sensors ability to detect human presence, the smart adaptors capability of turning off appliances and the Main servers monitoring skill were tested. The efficiency was based on the power consumption in two households wherein a decrease of 20-28% in the total power consumption with Smart Adaptor was measured. The average response time of 0.95 seconds proved the reliability of the PIR sensor to detect human presence within the range of 105o within 5.4 meters distance and 2.74 meters width. The connectivity of the PIR and main server had an accuracy of 90% while that of the smart adaptor to the main server was 85%. Hence, the three main components in a system were acceptable to the respondents with 4.35 overall rating. Thus, the system was capable of monitoring home appliances and reduces fire breakouts at the same time.</p>
